## EDITING DISCIPLINE (mandatory) — high-cost bugs to avoid

These four failure modes recurred in the 2026-05-14 CTG run and burned
30+ minutes of debug time each. Read this section BEFORE doing any
delete-slide / insert-slide / reorder-slide / custom-layout work.

### E1. Identifier sync on delete/insert — what's mandatory vs conditional

A slide can carry up to three numeric identifiers, at different DOM levels:

| Identifier | Lives on | Status | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `data-screen-label="NN Title"` | `.slide` element | **mandatory** | present-mode pager UI label; validator R02 requires it |
| `data-text-id="slide-NN.field"` | every text leaf | **mandatory if texts.md sidecar exists** | links HTML → texts.md (T01–T03) |
| `data-page="NN"` | `.slide-frame` wrapper | **conditional — only when the slide has per-page scoped CSS** | per-page `[data-page="07"] .card { ... }` overrides authored in the deck's inline `<style>` |

The first two are always required (validator enforces). `data-page`
is **purely a CSS-scoping handle** the author opts into when they need
per-page overrides — most Path A (template-rendered) slides don't have
it at all (Opple deck: 0/51 frames carry `data-page`; CTG deck: 36/53
have it because that deck has heavy per-page custom CSS).

**Renumber ritual on delete / insert / reorder** — only update the
identifiers that EXIST on the affected slides:

1. Decide the new ordinal map (e.g. inserting at position 7 → all
   positions ≥ 7 shift +1).
2. **Always** — update `data-screen-label="NN Title"` on every affected
   `.slide`.
3. **Always (if texts.md exists)** — update `data-text-id="slide-NN.field"`
   on every affected text leaf, and the matching `## slide-NN` headers
   in `texts.md`. Use Edit's `replace_all` carefully — scope to the
   affected slide's markup, not the whole file.
4. **Only if `data-page="NN"` is on the affected `.slide-frame`** —
   renumber it too, AND grep for `[data-page="OLDNN"]` selectors in the
   deck's `<style>` blocks and renumber those to match. Skipping this
   leaves per-page CSS attached to the wrong frame (this is the bug
   that gave "第三页样式不对" in the 2026-05-14 CTG run; the slide had
   `data-page="03"` plus a `[data-page="03"] .card { … }` rule, and the
   renumber missed the frame attribute, so the rule fired on the wrong
   page after the delete).
5. Run `python3 assets/validate.py runs/<ts>/output/index.html` —
   R-DOM catches missing `</div>`, T03 catches texts.md drift, R20
   catches per-page CSS that's off the type-scale ladder.

**The deck on disk is your source of truth** for which identifiers
each slide carries — there is no "every slide MUST have data-page"
rule; it's purely conditional on whether per-page CSS exists.

If you find this ritual error-prone, prefer rewriting the slide list
end-to-end (regenerate with fresh ordinals 01..NN) rather than splicing
in place. The validator's R-DOM rule catches the most catastrophic case
(slide-frame nesting from regex-eaten `</div>`); the identifier sync
is editorial — only you can do it right.

### E2. Don't use sed / regex / text substitution to edit slide-frames

Three separate bugs in the CTG run came from using Python regex to splice
HTML for slide insertion / deletion / column-content rotation:

- `(<div class="slide-frame"...)` matched mid-frame instead of frame-start
  because the regex didn't anchor to the `<div ` token boundary. Result:
  insertion landed inside an existing slide-frame, nesting 7 subsequent
  frames inside it. Present mode hid them all (they never became "current").
- `</[a-zA-Z]+>` was the close-tag pattern used in a column-content
  rotation. It correctly closes `</span>` and `</p>` but does NOT match
  `</h3>` (HTML allows digits in tag names; `[a-zA-Z]+` excludes them).
  Result: regex consumed past the h3 and ate the entire next column's
  markup until it found a `</span>` further down.
- Plain text replacement of "第一段" → "新内容" stripped a closing `</div>`
  that lived inside the matched span.

**Rule**: do not use regex / sed / plain text replacement to manipulate
slide DOM structure. For editorial text changes use `apply-texts.py`
(parses by `data-text-id`, position-safe). For structural changes
(insert / delete / move slide), do it by reading the file, identifying
the slide blocks manually, and writing back the full sequence.

**Safety net**: after every structural change, run validator R-DOM
(`audit_dom_integrity` in `validate.py`). It catches the catastrophic
nesting case automatically — every `.slide-frame` must be a direct
child of `.deck`, every frame must hold exactly one `.slide`, and
`<div>` opens must balance closes inside `<body>`. A structural API
helper (`assets/dom-ops.py`) may be added later if the rule proves
insufficient on its own; until then, R-DOM IS the structural defense.

### E3. Custom-layout selectors have lower specificity than framework defaults

Every framework `.slide[data-layout="..."] .grid { ... }` rule has
specificity `(0,2,0)` — one class + one attribute = 2 classes equivalent.
A naively-written custom layout `.slide-vs-wecom .grid { ... }` has
specificity `(0,2,0)` too — same level — but loses the cascade to the
framework because the framework rule was DECLARED LATER.

**Failure mode**: author writes `<div class="slide slide-vs-wecom"
data-layout="content-3up">` and defines `.slide-vs-wecom .grid {
display: flex; gap: 64px }`. Framework rule
`.slide[data-layout="content-3up"] .grid { display: grid;
grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; ... }` wins. The flex layout
silently doesn't apply. Content overflows 1080.

**Three ways to authoring around it**, in order of preference:

1. **Bump specificity by combining classes**: write
   `.slide.slide-vs-wecom .grid { ... }` (specificity `(0,3,0)`) — wins
   over the framework's `(0,2,0)` cleanly.
2. **Use `!important` on the directional / structural properties** —
   `display: flex !important; flex-direction: row !important;` — works
   but pollutes; reserve for layout direction, NOT for cosmetic values.
3. **Use absolute positioning** for the children of your custom layout
   instead of flex/grid. Specificity matters less when each child has
   its own `position: absolute; top: ...; left: ...`.

Watch out for the related trap: don't name your custom class with a
reserved framework class name (`.tile`, `.pill`, `.card`, `.eyebrow`,
`.keyline`, `.title-zh`, `.wordmark`, `.stage`, `.header`, `.footer`,
`.deck`, `.slide`, `.slide-frame`). See "Reserved class names" section
for the full list — collisions cause force-shrink and other surprise
behavior beyond just specificity.

### E4. Pre-delivery R06 / R20 enforcement is NOT optional

The validator already enforces:
- **R06** — body text ≥ 22 px on slide content; chrome ≥ 14 px.
- **R20** — every `font-size` in per-page `<style>` blocks must come from
  the modular type-scale ladder `{10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 22, 28, 38,
  44, 52, 56, 64, 88, 100, 132, 160}`.
- **R-WHITE-TEXT** — content text on dark slides must be `#fff`, never
  `rgba(255,255,255,X<1)`. Low-opacity white reads as gray when
  projected.

These rules existed before the CTG run, but they were violated **at
least 4 times** in that run because the agent wrote inline `<style>` and
shipped without re-validating. Users had to flag the under-floor fonts
every single time.

**Workflow rule for the agent**:

After every Edit that touches CSS inside a `<style>` block of the deck —
especially per-page `<style data-page="NN">` blocks — IMMEDIATELY run:

```bash
python3 assets/validate.py runs/<ts>/output/index.html
```

Don't wait until "final delivery". Don't trust visual eyeballing for
font-size rules — what looks fine on a desktop preview vanishes on a
projector. R06 / R20 / R-WHITE-TEXT exist exactly because human
judgment fails on these consistently.

Treat each violation as a delivery blocker. If you write 16 px because
you think it fits, the rule still rejects — fix to 14 (chrome) or 18
(pill) or 22 (body), not 16.

### E5. Delete an element → rebalance the rest in the same pass (mandatory)

When the user says "删 X" / "去掉 Y" / "Z 不要了",**the task is two
operations, not one**: (1) remove the element, AND (2) rebalance the
surrounding layout so the deleted slot doesn't leave a visible hole.
Validator PASS ≠ visually balanced. Shipping a "successfully deleted"
deck with a giant blank in the middle is failure, even if every R-rule
passes.

**Why this is mandatory** (user feedback 2026-05-22 · slide 15 after
deleting the closing block + the flow-row + the subtitle):

> "这么改完中间太空了,这个你不觉得难看么?为什么要这样设计,之后别这样了"

The agent had treated "delete the closing 3-line block" as a textual
removal and shipped without checking that the remaining `.ttl-block +
.preface + .dept-grid` now top-aligned with a half-screen blank below.
The `dept-grid { flex: 1 }` did fill the space, but each card's interior
content (5 short children + `margin-top: auto` on `.card-stuck`) only
filled ~60% of the now-taller card → ugly empty middles in every card.

Three deletion symptoms that ALWAYS need rebalancing:

| Symptom of recent deletion | Rebalance action |
|---|---|
| `.stage` flex-column lost a child → top-aligned remainder with bottom blank | Add `justify-content: center` (or `space-between`) on `.stage` so the remaining group sits visually centered, not stuck-top. Reference: R48 default centering. |
| Grid row was occupied by deleted element → leftover row stretch grew the rest | Either shrink `grid-template-rows` to match the new row count, OR drop `flex: 1` on the grid so it sizes to content + center it in `.stage`. Reference: BF3 stretch overshoot. |
| Card had N fields with `margin-top: auto` on one (pushing it to bottom); now N-1 fields | Drop `margin-top: auto`, change card to `justify-content: space-between`. The auto-margin trick assumes a specific child count; deleting breaks the assumption. Reference: BF9. |
| Subtitle deleted, title now alone at top | Either bump title font (36→48), or increase `margin-top` on the title so it sits in the visual upper-third instead of pinned to the top edge. |
| Removed 1-2 cards from a `repeat(N, 1fr)` grid | Drop N by 1 (`repeat(N-1, 1fr)`), don't leave the grid with one stretched orphan cell. |

**Mechanical checklist** (run mentally after every Edit that removes
DOM content):

1. Squint at the slide at 1/3 zoom — is there a visible blank band
   (top, middle, or bottom)?
2. If yes, identify which container houses the blank (stage / grid /
   card).
3. Apply the matching fix from the table above.
4. Re-render. Re-squint. If still blank, repeat.

**Anti-pattern**: delete → render → "完成了 · PASS" → ship. This is the
exact failure mode the user called out. Even if the validator is green,
**you owe a visual rebalance pass**.

**Trigger scope (mandatory — broader than "after delete")**: the squint
check + rebalance flow above must run whenever you touch a slide for
ANY of these reasons:

- You **deleted** DOM content (the original trigger).
- You **edited / fixed / restyled** a slide the user pointed at
  ("这页有问题", "改一下 #NN", "看看 slide NN").
- You **inherited** a slide from another flow / earlier in the session
  / another deck and the user is now asking you to look at it.
- You're about to **deliver / hand off** the deck or any specific page.

Common failure pattern (2026-05-22 · slide 17 NPD-4-stage): a slide
ships with `.acts { flex: 1 }` containing only 3 short act rows →
container stretches, content top-aligns, bottom half empty. The slide
was authored by another flow, not by my edit, so E5's "after delete"
trigger never fired. The user catches "中间还是空着好多内容,刚加的
规则怎么没实现" — they're right. The rule is about **the visual end
state**, not just about who edited last. **If you're looking at a
slide for any reason, you own the squint check**.

The 30-second squint pass is cheap. Shipping a holed-out slide and
being told "你不觉得难看么" is expensive.

**Watch for the inverse trap too**: if the user ADDS content, check
whether the now-fuller layout has the OPPOSITE problem (overflow,
R-VIS-CARD-OVERFLOW, cards too tall to fit). Add and delete are symmetric
— both shift the layout, both need a rebalance check.
