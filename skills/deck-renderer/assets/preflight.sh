# deck-renderer · preflight check
# Verifies a local mount is present and writable before any skill action.
#
# Usage: bash assets/preflight.sh
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  OK — running from a writable mount OR successfully bootstrapped a
#      writable mirror of a read-only skill mount. Distinguish between the
#      two via stdout (see "stdout markers" below).
#   1  no mount detected / required skill files missing in source
#   2  read-only AND no writable area available for bootstrap
#   3  ephemeral session output only (/sessions/*/mnt/outputs/) — not allowed
#
# stdout markers (always on the first line of the success/fail message):
#   PREFLIGHT OK              skill root is writable, run skill from $SKILL_ROOT
#   PREFLIGHT BOOTSTRAPPED    skill root was RO; mirrored to a writable
#                             workspace — agent MUST cd into the printed
#                             workspace path before any further skill commands
#   PREFLIGHT FAIL · exit N   gated, do not proceed
#
# Why bootstrap exists: harnesses like Mira mount the skill read-only into
# /opt or similar. We can't write runs/<ts>/{input,output}/ next to assets/
# in that case. Instead we rsync the whole skill (minus runs/, .git/) into
# $PWD/.deck-renderer-workspace (override via FS_DECK_WORKSPACE env var),
# and tell the agent to cd there. All relative paths inside the skill (CSS
# link, template lookups, render.py) keep working unchanged.
#
# This script is the LAST LINE of the skill's preflight. It's a hard gate;
# any non-zero exit means the agent must STOP and refuse to proceed.
