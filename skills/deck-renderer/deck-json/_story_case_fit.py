"""Shared story-case (content/story-case) schema-fit primitives.

PLACEHOLDER_PATTERNS was copy-pasted byte-for-byte across render-deck.py
(the renderer's --skip-fit-check refusal) and validate-deck.py (the deck.json
business-rule check); the min-length thresholds were expressed two ways. They
drive the SAME fit decision, so a divergence between the copies would let a
beat that one tool rejects slip past the other. Single-sourced here per F-15;
both modules import from this file.

NOTE: validate-deck.py's check_business_rules() inlines the per-field minimums
(1 / 2 / 10) in its fit_fields table — those MUST stay equal to _min_len_for()
below. _min_len_for is the canonical mapping. stdlib-only, no deps.
