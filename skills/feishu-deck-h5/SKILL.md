name: feishu-deck-h5
description: |
  Use this skill whenever the user asks for a Feishu/Lark-style slide deck rendered as a single
  HTML file (NOT a real .pptx). Triggers: "飞书风格 PPT", "Lark deck", "汇报材料", "客户提案",
  "h5 deck", "presentation html", "16:9 网页演示", "用 html 模仿 ppt", "深色商务汇报",
  or whenever the user attaches the 飞书 .thmx master and asks for an HTML version. The skill
  produces a dark, cinematic deck at 1920×1080 design canvas with auto-responsive scale-to-fit,
  plus a built-in mobile vertical browse mode in the same file. The default language is
  CHINESE-ONLY (the body text, card titles, agenda items, section labels are all ZH; do NOT
  mirror them with EN translations underneath). Bilingual ZH + EN output is opt-in only —
  switch to it only when the user explicitly asks (e.g. for an external bilingual customer
  pitch). Outputs look indistinguishable from a hand-built Lark sales deck. Do NOT use this
  skill when the user actually wants a real PowerPoint (.pptx) file — that's the pptx skill.

# feishu-deck-h5

> **🛑 STOP — read this preflight before doing anything else.**

## PREFLIGHT (mandatory, blocks all work) — local mount required

This skill is **ONLY valid in local-mount mode**. If the user has not
mounted a writable local folder, the skill MUST refuse to proceed and
must NOT write anything to ephemeral session storage.

### Why this is mandatory

Decks generated in temporary session storage (`/sessions/.../mnt/outputs/`)
are **wiped between conversations**. Without a local mount:

- The user loses the deck the moment the conversation ends.
- Brand assets (`lark-*.png/jpg`) can't be reused across decks.
- Multiple people on the same team can't collaborate or version-control.
- The user can't `git commit` what they generated.
- The generated HTML can't be opened in the user's own browser via
  `file://` because the session is sandboxed.

The skill is designed for persistent, team-shareable, version-controlled
decks. Running without a mount defeats every reason this skill exists.

### Required preflight steps (run IN ORDER)

**Step P-1.** Check `<env>` in your system context for the line
`User selected a folder: yes/no`.
- If `yes` → continue to Step P-2.
- If `no` → go to Step P-3 (request mount).

**Step P-2.** Verify the mount is writable by running:

```bash
bash assets/preflight.sh
```

The script exits 0 on success. Exit codes 1 / 2 / 3 mean: no mount /
read-only / running from ephemeral output. Any non-zero exit blocks
all subsequent work.

**Step P-2.5.** If the script's stdout contains the line
`WARNING · another clone of this repo lives on disk:`, the user has
TWO checkouts of `feishu-deck-h5` on the machine (e.g. one in
`~/Documents/Github/feishu-deck-h5/` and one in the Claude Code
session-mount path). Outputs you create here will NOT appear in the
other one — same GitHub remote, different filesystem directories.

**STOP. Do NOT call `new-run.sh` yet.** Surface the conflict to the
user and ask which clone they want this run's deck to land in:

> "我看到你机器上有两份 feishu-deck-h5 的 clone：
> · 我现在挂载的：`<current skill root>`
> · 另一份：`<other clone path>`
>
> 这次生成的 `runs/<ts>/` 只会出现在我挂载的这份里。如果你平时
> 在另一份编辑/commit，我建议切到那份再继续。要切吗？"

If the user says "切到 X" / "use the other one", abort this run and
ask them to re-invoke the skill with Claude Code mounted at the
other path. If the user says "use this one" / explicitly picks the
current root, proceed to Step W-1.

**Step P-3.** Call `mcp__cowork__request_cowork_directory` and ask the
user to select their project folder. Phrase the request like:

> "I need to mount your local working directory before generating a
> deck — outputs need to persist beyond this session and be available
> in your editor / browser. Please select the folder where you want
> the deck files to live (e.g. `~/Projects/2026-customer-deck/`)."

**Step P-4.** If the user declines or the mount call fails or P-2 still
fails after P-3, STOP and reply with this exact message:

> "feishu-deck-h5 requires a local mounted folder so generated decks
> persist beyond this conversation, can be opened in your browser, and
> can be version-controlled. I can't proceed without one. Please select
> a working directory and ask me again, or use a different tool that
> doesn't require local persistence."

**Do NOT** generate any HTML in `/sessions/*/mnt/outputs/`. **Do NOT**
hand-wave with "I'll generate it temporarily". **Do NOT** offer to
inline everything into a single message. The skill is gated; honor the
gate.

### What "local mount" looks like in practice

| State | Filesystem indicator | Action |
|---|---|---|
| User cloned the repo + mounted | `~/Projects/feishu-deck-h5/` mounted; SKILL.md visible | OK, proceed |
| User mounted a parent project folder | `~/Projects/q1-pitch/` mounted; cloned skill in subfolder OR via plugin install | OK, proceed |
| User mounted a fresh empty folder | Mounted but no skill files yet | Copy skill files into the mount first (`git clone` or copy from `~/.claude/skills/`), then proceed |
| User has not mounted anything | `User selected a folder: no` in env | Request mount, refuse if declined |
| Working in `/sessions/*/mnt/outputs/` only | `preflight.sh` returns exit 3 | Treat as no-mount, refuse |

The skill treats "ephemeral outputs only" the same as "no mount" — both
are non-persistent and equally broken for this skill's purpose.

---

## WORKSPACE LAYOUT (mandatory) — per-run `runs/<timestamp>/` folder

After PREFLIGHT passes, but **before generating any HTML**, the agent
MUST create a fresh per-run workspace and announce it to the user.
This is a non-negotiable convention so that:

- multiple deck attempts in the same project don't overwrite each other
- the user's source materials and the agent's outputs stay separated
- every run is timestamped and easy to find / archive / git-commit later

### Required structure

`runs/` lives at the **repo root**, NOT inside `skills/<skill-name>/`.
This avoids the common-case path bloat for a single-skill marketplace
repo: users see `<repo>/runs/<ts>/output/index.html`, not the deeper
`<repo>/skills/feishu-deck-h5/runs/<ts>/output/index.html`. `new-run.sh`
resolves "repo root" via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and falls back
to skill root only when the skill isn't inside a git tree.

```
<repo-root>/
├── README.md, INSTALL.md, install.sh, …   ← repo-level docs
├── runs/                                   ← ★ user artifacts live here
│   └── YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/                    ← one folder per skill invocation
│       ├── input/                          ← USER drops source files here
│       └── output/                         ← AGENT writes the deck + validate reports here
└── skills/feishu-deck-h5/                  ← skill source (don't write outputs here)
    ├── SKILL.md, assets/, templates/, examples/, …
    └── (no runs/ subfolder — runs are at repo root)
```

The deck's CSS / JS link in `runs/<ts>/output/index.html` points at the
skill's assets via a relative path:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../../../skills/feishu-deck-h5/assets/feishu-deck.css">
<script src="../../../skills/feishu-deck-h5/assets/feishu-deck.js"></script>
```

(Three `../` to climb from `output/` to repo root, then down into the
skill folder.)

### Required steps (run IN ORDER, after PREFLIGHT)

**Step W-1.** Create the run folder:

```bash
bash assets/new-run.sh
```

The script prints the absolute path of the new run folder and exits 0.
Capture the printed path; it is the working folder for everything below.

**Step W-2.** Announce the path to the user **in the same response**.
Use roughly this phrasing (translate to the user's language):

> "已为本次任务创建工作目录：
> `runs/<timestamp>/`
> · 请把素材（图片、PDF、参考稿、文案等）放到 `input/`
> · 我会把生成的 HTML deck 和验证报告写到 `output/`
> 准备好后告诉我即可继续。"

**Step W-3.** Wait for the user to drop files into `input/` (or to
confirm there are no source files — text-only briefs are fine, the
folder still exists for the deck to land in `output/`).

**Step W-4.** All subsequent file writes for this invocation MUST go
under `runs/<timestamp>/output/`. Never write the deck to
`examples/`, the repo root, or any other location. `examples/` is
reserved for the maintainers' reference sample.

### When NOT to create a new run folder

- The user explicitly says "edit the existing deck at `runs/.../output/X.html`"
  — in that case, reuse that run folder, don't create a new one.
- You are running `build.sh` to regenerate `examples/sample-deck.html`
  as a maintainer of this skill (not as an end-user delivery). `build.sh`
  is intentionally hardcoded to `examples/` and is out of scope for this
  rule.

---

## TEXT-EDIT SIDECAR (mandatory) — `data-text-id` + `texts.md`

Decks are 1500+ lines of dense HTML. Users CANNOT comfortably hunt through
markup to fix a typo or rewrite a sentence. Every deck this skill produces
MUST ship with a paired `texts.md` sidecar so the user can edit copy in
one ergonomic file and reapply the changes back into the HTML without
touching layout, CSS, decoration, or SVG mocks.

### Required deliverables (per run)

After PREFLIGHT and WORKSPACE setup, the agent's `runs/<timestamp>/output/`
folder MUST contain BOTH:

```
output/
  index.html          ← deck, every text leaf carries data-text-id="slide-NN.field"
  texts.md            ← sidecar, edit-only file paired with index.html
```

The user edits `texts.md`; running

```bash
python3 assets/apply-texts.py output/index.html output/texts.md
```

patches `index.html` in place (with a `.bak` first), changing only the
`textContent` of every element matching the changed ids. Layout, CSS,
SVG, decoration are byte-for-byte preserved.

### Authoring rule — every text leaf gets a `data-text-id`

When generating slide markup, every element whose inner content is plain
text (optionally containing `<br>`) MUST carry a `data-text-id` attribute
following this scheme:

```
data-text-id="slide-{NN}.{field}"
```

- `NN` is the zero-padded slide ordinal matching `data-screen-label`
  order (`slide-01`, `slide-02`, …). It MUST stay stable across
  regenerations of the same deck.
- `field` is a semantic, dot-namespaced name (`title`, `subtitle`,
  `card-01.body`, `agenda.item-03.zh`, `kpi-02.label`, `footer.brand`).
  Use ordinals (`-01`, `-02`) on repeating siblings even when there's
  only one today, so that adding a sibling later doesn't silently
  renumber the existing one.

**Examples (correct):**

```html
<h1 class="title" data-text-id="slide-01.title">先进团队的<br>工作方式</h1>
<p class="subtitle" data-text-id="slide-01.subtitle">The way advanced teams work</p>
<div class="agenda-item">
  <div class="n">01</div>
  <div class="title-zh" data-text-id="slide-02.agenda.item-01.zh">背景与挑战</div>
  <div class="title-en" data-text-id="slide-02.agenda.item-01.en">Context and challenges</div>
</div>
```

### Excluded from `data-text-id` (NEVER annotate these)

- `<svg>` and any element inside SVG (decorative, not user copy).
- `.pageno` (derived from slide order, never edited by hand).
- Anything inside `<script>`, `<style>`, `<noscript>`, HTML comments.
- The `<title>` in `<head>` (page-level metadata; edit the file directly
  if needed).
- Brand-locked text that must never change (e.g., the "飞书" wordmark)
  — these MAY be annotated for completeness, but MUST be flagged in
  `texts.md` with a `(brand-locked)` suffix in the field name comment.

### Mixed-text-and-inline rule (this is the trap)

If an element contains text AND inline tags other than `<br>` — for
instance `<blockquote>飞书让 30 万人 <span class="accent-text">像一个团队</span>
一样工作。</blockquote>` — DO NOT put a single `data-text-id` on the
parent. Instead, split the content into separate leaves:

```html
<blockquote>
  <span data-text-id="slide-06.quote.lead">飞书让 30 万人 </span>
  <span class="accent-text" data-text-id="slide-06.quote.emphasis">像一个团队</span>
  <span data-text-id="slide-06.quote.tail"> 一样工作。</span>
</blockquote>
```

This keeps every editable run a clean text leaf so `apply-texts.py` can
substitute it with no markup-aware logic. The cost is two extra `<span>`
wrappers, which CSS doesn't see (they have no class).

### `texts.md` format

A single flat file, one section per slide. The `extract-texts.py` script
generates it; the agent emits it directly when authoring a fresh deck.

```markdown
# {Deck title} — texts

> Edit text below. After save, run:
>   python3 assets/apply-texts.py <deck.html> <texts.md>
>
> Rules:
>   • Edit ONLY this file. Visual tweaks → overrides.css.
>     Layout / structure / new slides → re-ask Claude.
>   • Use `\n` to insert a line break (renders as <br>).
>   • Do NOT rename the slide-NN.field ids — they pair with HTML.

## slide-01 (cover) — 01 Cover
title: 先进团队的\n工作方式
subtitle: The way advanced teams work
author.role: 客户提案 · 2026.04
author.team: 飞书企业服务团队

## slide-02 (agenda) — 02 Agenda
title: 本次汇报共六个部分
agenda.item-01.zh: 背景与挑战
agenda.item-01.en: Context and challenges
…
```

- Section header: `## slide-NN (layout) — screen-label` exactly.
- Lines: `field-name: value` (single line). Use `\n` literal (two chars,
  backslash + n) to encode a `<br>` inside the value.
- Lines starting with `>` or `#` are comments / headers — ignored on
  apply.

### Edit discipline (relay to the user when delivering)

1. **Text changes → `texts.md`**, then run `apply-texts.py`. Never edit
   text directly in `index.html` (the next regeneration / re-extract
   will conflict).
2. **Visual / spacing / color tweaks → `overrides.css`** linked at the
   end of the deck. Never edit the inline CSS in the deck.
3. **Layout, new slides, structural changes → re-ask Claude.** That
   triggers a regeneration; ids must remain stable for slides that
   already existed.

### Tools shipped with the skill

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `assets/apply-texts.py [<html> <texts.md>] [--dry-run] [--check]` | Apply edits from texts.md back into HTML. With no args, defaults to `index.html` + `texts.md` in the script's own directory (so it works inside the bundled deliverable zip). `--check` exits 1 on drift. |
| `assets/extract-texts.py <html> [--out texts.md] [--annotate out.html]` | Bootstrap texts.md from a deck. Mode A: deck already annotated — just dump. Mode B: bare deck — auto-add `data-text-id` and emit annotated HTML alongside texts.md. |
| `assets/package-deliverable.sh <output-dir> [--name foo]` | Bundle the per-run output into `deck-editable.zip` containing `index.html`, `texts.md`, `apply-texts.py`, `apply.command` (macOS), `apply.bat` (Windows), and a user-facing `README.txt`. The recipient unzips, edits texts.md, double-clicks the launcher — no Claude Code or pip required, just stock Python 3. |

**Retrofit limitation**: `extract-texts.py` Mode B captures pure text
leaves only. Mixed-content elements (text + inline tags) are skipped —
the user must restructure them per the "mixed-text-and-inline rule"
above. For NEW decks the agent generates, this never comes up because
the agent splits leaves up front.

### Validator behaviour

`assets/validate.py` runs `audit_text_ids` (rule T01–T03) on every
deck. It enforces:

- T01 — every `data-text-id` value matches `^slide-\d+\.[\w.\-]+$`.
- T02 — `data-text-id` values are unique within the deck.
- T03 — if a paired `texts.md` lives next to the HTML, its id set
  matches the HTML's id set (no drift). For a per-run deck at
  `runs/<ts>/output/index.html`, the validator looks for
  `runs/<ts>/output/texts.md` automatically.

Decks with no `data-text-id` at all are flagged with a single warning
("texts.md sidecar not generated") rather than 200 individual errors,
so legacy / external decks still pass through.

---

## DELIVERY MODES — pick by harness

The skill produces files in `runs/<timestamp>/output/`. How those files
reach the human depends on which harness invoked the skill. Pick the
right delivery mode and call it out explicitly when handing off.

### Mode 1 · Claude Code on the user's local machine

Default. The user has filesystem access to `runs/<timestamp>/output/`
already. Just tell them the path:

> 已生成：
> · `runs/<ts>/output/index.html` — 浏览器双击打开
> · `runs/<ts>/output/texts.md` — 改文字时编辑这个，然后跑
>   `python3 assets/apply-texts.py runs/<ts>/output/index.html runs/<ts>/output/texts.md`

No packaging step needed.

### Mode 2 · OpenClaw / OpenCode / remote agent / Feishu bot

The skill ran in a sandbox the user can't reach. Filesystem paths are
useless. **Generate `deck-editable.zip` and ship that as the deliverable**:

```bash
bash assets/package-deliverable.sh runs/<ts>/output/
# produces: runs/<ts>/output/deck-editable.zip
```

The zip contains:

```
deck-editable.zip
├── index.html        ← the deck (single inlined file, viewable offline)
├── texts.md          ← editable copy of every visible string
├── apply-texts.py    ← engine, stdlib-only Python 3
├── apply.command     ← macOS one-click launcher (double-click)
├── apply.bat         ← Windows one-click launcher
└── README.txt        ← user-facing instructions, including macOS Gatekeeper
                       and Windows Python install notes
```

Hand the zip to the harness for delivery. Typical bot flows:

- **Feishu bot**: send as file attachment via `im/v1/messages` with a
  one-line caption ("飞书风格 deck — 解压后双击 index.html 看，改文字看 README.txt").
  ~15-30 KB for the launchers/scripts plus whatever the deck weighs
  (typically 50-300 KB inlined).
- **OpenClaw remote**: return the zip path; OpenClaw's transport layer
  handles uploading or attaching it to the response.
- **Slack / email / etc.**: same — attach the zip.

The user does not need Claude Code, OpenClaw, or pip. Only stock
`python3` (default on macOS, one-time install on Windows).

### Mode 3 · View-only delivery (when editability isn't needed)

If the recipient is "客户/老板看一眼就行" and editing is not in scope,
ship just the inlined `index.html` (no zip, no texts.md, no scripts).
Use `build.sh --inline` to produce a fully self-contained single file.

This loses the texts.md edit loop — only choose it when you're certain
the recipient is consuming, not authoring.

### Choosing between Mode 2 and Mode 3

Default to **Mode 2 (zip with edit kit)** unless the user explicitly
says "this is the final version, no more edits" or "send to the
customer, just the visual." Most internal handoffs eventually need
copy tweaks; shipping the edit kit pre-empts a round-trip back to you.

---

## LANGUAGE POLICY (mandatory) — Chinese-only by default

When the user writes to you in Chinese, **every piece of slide copy is
ZH-only**. Do NOT pair Chinese with English translations underneath
("instinct sync / Instant sync" stacked, "三大共识 / Three principles"
stacked). Bilingual ZH + EN is opt-in only — switch to it ONLY when the
user explicitly asks (e.g. "give me a bilingual deck for an external
customer", "面向英文客户"). The default is monolingual ZH.

### Why this is mandatory

- Internal team / customer-summary decks read like marketing
  brochures when every Chinese line is mirrored in English. Native
  Chinese speakers find the EN line redundant and visually noisy.
- The flower-master visual + 飞书 brand wordmark is already strongly
  Chinese-aligned. Stacking EN underneath every ZH item dilutes that.
- Most decks this skill produces are internal alignment / 汇报材料 /
  客户提案 — none of these need an EN translation track.

### Specifically — drop these by default

| Element | Old (bilingual) | New (default ZH-only) |
|---|---|---|
| Agenda item | `<div class="title-zh">背景与挑战</div><div class="title-en">Context and challenges</div>` | `<div class="title-zh">背景与挑战</div>` (drop the `.title-en` div entirely) |
| `content-3up` card title | `<h3 class="ctitle">即时同步<br>Instant sync</h3>` | `<h3 class="ctitle">即时同步</h3>` (drop the `<br>` and EN line) |
| Two-hand-arch motto | `<h3>左手 · 透明化管控</h3><span class="em">CONTROL</span>` | `<h3>左手 · 透明化管控</h3>` (drop the `.em` EN motto span) |
| Cover subtitle | `<p class="subtitle">The way advanced teams work</p>` | (already removed by Step 2 cover spec — no subtitle at all) |
| Section lede | "实时同步 · 共识对齐 · 闭环交付 / Instant sync · …" | "即时同步 · 共识对齐 · 闭环交付" (no EN trail) |

### When bilingual IS appropriate (opt-in)

Switch to bilingual ZH + EN ONLY when the user says one of:
- "做一份双语的 deck"
- "面向 [国际/英文/海外] 客户"
- "ZH + EN bilingual"
- Or the user is writing to you in English and the deck is for a
  Chinese audience the user is helping.

In those cases, restore `.title-en` divs in agenda, EN second line in
card titles, and so on. The CSS shipped already supports both modes
without any token changes.

### Tokenized vocabulary stays English

Brand names (Lark, Base, Wiki, Meetings), product code names
(Salesforce, C360), numerical units (px, pt, %), and tokenized
vocabulary (KPI, ROI, OKR, CEO, KOL, agent, demo) stay in their
original form even in ZH-only decks. The ban is on **translation
tracks**, not on every Latin-script word.

---

Generate a dark, cinematic Lark / 飞书 brand-aligned **HTML deck** at 1920×1080 in a single
self-contained file that:

- looks identical on PC at 16:9 fullscreen,
- gracefully reflows to a vertical browse on mobile,
- never invents tokens — pulls every color, font size, gradient, radius, and spacing
  from `assets/feishu-deck.css`,
- ships with a built-in present mode (←/→/space, click-to-go), a scroll mode (mobile),
  a mode toggle, page indicator, and URL hash sync.

This skill is the **canonical interpretation** of the 飞书母版 2025 (深色通用) PowerPoint
master, expressed as design tokens and layout recipes.

---

## When to use this skill

Use it when the user wants:
- a slide deck delivered as an HTML file (not a `.pptx`)
- something that *looks like* a Lark / 飞书 / ByteDance enterprise pitch
- a dark, bilingual ZH+EN sales / quarterly / customer-pitch presentation
- both PC fullscreen and mobile-viewable in one artifact

If the user explicitly asks for `.pptx`, route to the **pptx** skill instead.

If the user asks for a generic non-Feishu deck (e.g. white background, Apple style),
this skill is the wrong choice — its design tokens are brand-locked.

### Brand assets — must travel with every deck

Every deck depends on these six image files, which were lifted directly from the
official **飞书 母版 2025（深色通用）** PowerPoint master. They live in `assets/` and are
referenced via CSS variables (`--fs-asset-logo` etc.). For single-file delivery, base64-
inline them into a `:root { --fs-asset-… }` override block — see how
`examples/sample-deck.html` does it.

| Variable                | Default file                  | Source (from .thmx)         | Used by             |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| `--fs-asset-logo`       | `lark-logo.png`               | `theme/media/image3.png`    | cover, end (top-left, color) |
| `--fs-asset-logo-mono`  | `lark-logo-mono-white.png`    | recolored from image3.png   | section + every content page (top-right, mono) |
| `--fs-asset-cover-bg`   | `lark-cover-bg.jpg`           | `theme/media/image2.jpg`    | cover, end backgrounds |

## Converting existing material (PDF / HTML / PPT export / docs) into a compliant deck

When the user hands you ANY existing material — a PDF report, an old HTML
deck, an exported PPT screenshot set, a markdown brief, a Google Slides
share — and asks for a "feishu-deck-h5 version", **follow this workflow
exactly**. Skipping any step produces the failure modes the user has
specifically called out before:

- mono-white logo on every page (should be color)
- content slides made with `data-layout="cover"` (wrong; cover has flower bg)
- end page with title + CTA + 4-col contact grid (master spec is slogan only)
- multi-layer header on content pages with eyebrow + title + subtitle
- `<br>` inside content-page titles
- pre-existing watermarks / page numbers carried over

### Step 1 · Inventory the source

For every source page, write down:

| Source page | Role identifier | Likely target layout |
|---|---|---|
| Cover / 主标题 / title slide / first big-image page | hero, lots of negative space | `cover` |
| Table of contents / 目录 / agenda / outline | numbered list of sections | `agenda` |
| Section divider / chapter intro / 章节页 / 大序号 | giant numeral + chapter title | `section` |
| 3 parallel concepts / 三大能力 / capabilities triplet | 3 cards in a row | `content-3up` |
| Body text + chart / one narrative + supporting visual | left text, right image/mock | `content-2col` |
| Customer quote / 金句 / executive thesis | single sentence centered | `quote` |
| 4 KPIs in a row / metrics dashboard | numbers + units + labels | `stats` |
| Single hero number with paragraph | one big number, side prose | `big-stat` |
| Full-bleed photo + text | photograph + bottom-left caption | `image-text` |
| Comparison matrix / feature table | rows × columns of text | `table` |
| Roadmap / chronological milestones | linear timeline with stages | `timeline` |
| 3-6 sequential workflow steps | process flow with arrows | `process` |
| Closing / 谢谢 / 封底 / "thank you" | final visual signature | `end` |

If a source page doesn't fit any of these 13, it's almost always a
content page in disguise — most likely `content-3up` or `content-2col`.
Do NOT invent a 14th layout.

### Step 2 · Cover page (`data-layout="cover"`) — MUST follow master spec

The cover is intentionally minimal: **title + initiator name + date,
nothing else**. NO English subtitle, NO team/company line, NO meeting
type label. The cover earns its weight through composition, not text
volume — the right-half flower image carries the atmosphere.

| Element | Spec |
|---|---|
| Background | `lark-cover-bg.jpg` (the master flower image — NOT a solid color, NOT a gradient invented on the fly) |
| Logo | top-LEFT at (120, 113), size 235×74, **COLORED** tri-petal `--fs-asset-logo` |
| Title | left-half only (max-width 884px), 100/700, can be 1-2 lines (hero allowed `<br>`) |
| Subtitle | **NONE** (no EN translation, no marketing tagline — drop it; if you really need a sentence, put it on slide 02) |
| Author block | bottom-left at top:803. Two stacked spans separated by `<br>`: line 1 = the **initiator's personal name** (the meeting host / deck owner / report author — NOT a team / department / role title); line 2 = the date (`YYYY.MM.DD`). |
| Footer chrome | NONE (cover doesn't have a footer row) |
| Eyebrow | NONE |

```html
<div class="slide" data-layout="cover" data-screen-label="01 Cover">
  <div class="wordmark">飞书</div>
  <div class="stage">
    <h1 class="title title-zh" data-text-id="slide-01.title">〔主标题 — can wrap with &lt;br&gt;〕</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="author">
    <span data-text-id="slide-01.author">〔发起人名字〕</span><br>
    <span data-text-id="slide-01.date">〔YYYY.MM.DD〕</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Why the minimalism is non-negotiable** (this rule was elevated from
user feedback after a 2026-Q2 deck):

- An EN subtitle on every cover reads like marketing copy — clients
  who only need an internal summary find it noisy.
- A team line ("飞书企业服务团队") is generic; an actual person's name
  ("杰森" / "FuQiang") tells the reader who to push back to.
- The cover is a hero composition; the less text it carries, the more
  the title and the flower image can breathe.

If the user explicitly asks for an English subtitle on a particular
deck (e.g. for a bilingual external pitch), allow it — but the
default authoring behavior is "no subtitle" unless asked.

### Step 3 · Every content page — title-only header + colored top-right logo

```html
<div class="slide" data-layout="content-3up" data-screen-label="04 Content">
  <div class="wordmark">飞书</div>           ← top-RIGHT, COLORED, 160×50 (auto from CSS)
  <div class="header">
    <h2 class="title-zh">〔Source title — single line, no &lt;br&gt;〕</h2>
  </div>
  <!-- body content (.grid / .flow / .nodes / .table-wrap / etc.) -->
  <div class="footer"><span>〔brand line · client name〕</span><span class="pageno">04</span></div>
</div>
```

What you MUST drop from the source:
- Eyebrow / kicker text above the title (R56)
- Subtitle / lead text below the title
- Inline page numbers in the header (footer only)
- Source page numbers in any other position
- Decorative breadcrumbs / "you are here" indicators
- Watermarks
- `<br>` inside the title — shorten the title instead (R13)
- Emoji, `!`, `…`, `???` — strip without asking (R05)

What you MUST preserve:
- Atmospheric backgrounds via `data-decor` (e.g. violet-glow on Digital
  Workforce / AI pages — see "Preserve atmospheric / decorative
  backgrounds when re-rendering")
- System UI / app screenshots → recreate as HTML using `.ui-*` primitives,
  NOT as raster images (UI1)
- Photographic backgrounds → use `data-decor="photo-bg"` with `style="--photo: url(...)"`

### Step 4 · End page (`data-layout="end"`) — MUST follow master spec

The 飞书 master closing is intentionally minimal: flower background +
colored logo top-left + slogan PNG. **No title. No CTA. No contact
grid.** Optional contact line allowed.

| Element | Spec |
|---|---|
| Background | `lark-cover-bg.jpg` (same as cover) |
| Logo | top-LEFT at (120, 121), COLORED, 235×74 |
| Slogan | `lark-slogan.png` ("先进团队 先用飞书") at (102, 348), 561×345 |
| Contact line | optional, bottom-left at top:80 |
| Title / CTA / contact grid | NONE (off-master, do not add) |
| Footer | NONE |

```html
<div class="slide" data-layout="end" data-screen-label="13 End">
  <div class="wordmark">飞书</div>
  <div class="slogan" role="img" aria-label="先进团队 先用飞书"></div>
  <!-- optional, off-master -->
  <div class="contact">contact@feishu.cn  ·  feishu.cn</div>
</div>
```

If the source has CTA pills / contact grids and you really need to keep
them, break with the master and document the deviation in the deck's
opening comment. Default = stay with the master.

### Step 5 · Run the validator BEFORE responding

```bash
bash build.sh --inline
python3 assets/validate.py examples/sample-deck.html --strict
python3 assets/validate.py examples/sample-deck-inline.html --strict
```

All four must exit 0. If any check fails (R49 cyan-as-accent, L1 mono
logo, R13 br-in-title, R56 eyebrow-in-header, P50 base64 budget),
**fix the markup, don't suppress the check**.

### Common conversion mistakes (forbidden)

| Mistake | Why it's wrong | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Use `data-layout="cover"` for an internal "agenda" or "section" page | Cover layout has the flower background and left-half text positioning that doesn't suit an agenda | Use `agenda` or `section` |
| Use mono-white logo on content pages | Mono is opt-in for over-imagery edge cases only (L1) | Use the default colored logo |
| Multi-line `<h2>` on content pages with `<br>` | Forbidden by R13 | Shorten the title; if it really needs two lines, the source title is too long for a deck |
| Add eyebrow above content page title | Forbidden by R56 | Drop the eyebrow; if context is essential, put it in the footer brand line |
| Re-use source page numbers verbatim in the title area | Page no. lives in the footer only | Add `<span class="pageno">07</span>` inside the footer |
| Inline raster screenshots of 飞书 UI as `<img>` | Forbidden by UI1 | Recreate using `.ui-window / .ui-grid / .ui-list / .ui-msg` etc. |
| Use cyan as a slide accent | Forbidden by R49 (cyan = inline highlight only) | Pick blue / teal / purple / violet / orange instead |

---

## Operational notes (gotchas)

- **`templates/_shell.html` uses `../assets/feishu-deck.css`.** It assumes the
  shell stays one directory deep relative to `assets/`. If you `cp` it to a
  new working directory, fix the relative paths to point at the actual
  `assets/` location, or run `bash build.sh` from the skill root which
  handles the rewrite automatically.
- **`data-decor="flower-bg"` and `"photo-bg"` use `!important` to override
  layout backgrounds.** They REPLACE the layout's default background image —
  intentional, so you can carry the cover atmosphere onto a content page.
  The auto-darkening protection gradient is added on non-cover/non-end
  layouts only (cover and end have their own contrast strategies).
- **CSS rule `.deck[data-mode="scroll"] ~ .deck-ui` relies on `.deck-ui`
  being a later sibling of `.deck`.** `feishu-deck.js` always appends the
  UI to `document.body` so this holds, but if you wrap `.deck` in a parent
  container or insert nodes between `.deck` and `.deck-ui`, the sibling
  selector breaks. The JS belt-and-suspenders `display: none` keeps it
  working in practice — but if you embed the deck inside a custom shell,
  prefer toggling `body.is-scroll` instead.

---

## Quick start (recommended workflow)

1. **Read DESIGN.md** end-to-end. Token names matter — the LLM that generates the deck
   must reference `--fs-*` variables, not hex values.
2. **Open `examples/sample-deck.html` in a browser** to confirm the rendering pipeline
   works on the user's machine. This is the visual ground truth.
3. **Open `templates/_shell.html`**. Copy it to the user's working directory, rename
   to whatever the project is (e.g. `2026-Q1-customer-deck.html`).
4. **Author the slide order**. Sketch the deck arc first, then for each slide:
   - pick a layout from the table below
   - copy the corresponding markup block from `templates/slide-recipes.html`
   - drop it into the shell, fill the placeholders, set `data-screen-label`,
     and increment the footer page number.
5. **Annotate every text leaf with `data-text-id`** as you author markup, and
   emit a paired `texts.md` next to `index.html`. See "TEXT-EDIT SIDECAR"
   above for the ID scheme and format. The user edits `texts.md` to fix
   copy without touching layout.
6. **Run the self-check** (final section of this file). The validator
   enforces the text-id scheme and `texts.md` sync.
7. **Deliver as one HTML file**. Inline the CSS + JS for portability if the user
   wants a single attachment (see "Single-file inlined output" below).
   Tell the user the workflow: edit `texts.md` → run
   `python3 assets/apply-texts.py output/index.html output/texts.md`.

---

## Available layouts

Pick by content, not by aesthetic. Each layout corresponds to a `data-layout` attribute
on `.slide`. Full markup lives in `templates/slide-recipes.html`.

| Layout            | Use when                                     | Accent default |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|---|
| `cover`           | First slide. Title + EN subtitle + brand + date. | blue |
| `agenda`          | TOC. 4–8 numbered items in 2 columns.        | blue |
| `section`         | Chapter divider. Giant `01` numeral + ZH title + EN lede + product pills. | blue |
| `content-3up`     | Three parallel pillars / capabilities / pillars. | blue |
| `content-2col`    | One narrative + supporting visual / mock / list. | blue |
| `quote`           | Single customer / executive quote, centered.  | blue |
| `stats`           | 4-up KPI row with big numbers as evidence.   | **teal** |
| `big-stat`        | One hero number (e.g. `30万`) + paragraph.    | blue |
| `image-text`      | Single full-bleed photo with type bottom-left. | blue |
| `table`           | Comparison or matrix. Up to 6 rows × 5 cols. | blue |
| `timeline`        | Chronological 4–6 milestones along an axis.  | blue |
| `process`         | 3–6 sequential steps with right-pointing arrows. | blue |
| `end`             | Closing — title + CTA pills + contact grid.  | blue |

**Mix rule.** A 12-slide deck typically uses 7–9 distinct layouts. Repeat `content-3up`
for parallel concepts; otherwise alternate to keep rhythm.

---

## The shell (single-file deck skeleton)

`templates/_shell.html` provides the canonical structure. Inline gist:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="zh-CN">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">
  <title>〔Deck title〕 · Lark Suite</title>
  <!-- For per-run decks at <repo>/runs/<ts>/output/index.html, the CSS / JS
       path needs to climb three levels then dive into the skill folder: -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../../../skills/feishu-deck-h5/assets/feishu-deck.css">
  <!-- Or inline the css for single-file delivery: see "Single-file inlined output" -->
</head>
<body>
  <div class="deck">
    <div class="slide-frame">
      <div class="slide" data-layout="cover" data-screen-label="01 Cover">
        ... cover markup ...
      </div>
    </div>
    <!-- more <div class="slide-frame"> entries -->
  </div>
  <script src="../../../skills/feishu-deck-h5/assets/feishu-deck.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Do not change the DOM order: `.deck > .slide-frame > .slide`. The runtime relies on it.

---

## Layout recipes (canonical copy-paste markup)

Each recipe below is the exact markup the agent should drop into a `.slide-frame`.
The markup uses only tokens defined in `assets/feishu-deck.css`.

### 1. Cover (`data-layout="cover"`) — matches 飞书 母版 slideLayout1

The cover uses the master flower background (`lark-cover-bg.jpg`) with content positioned on the **left half** (the dark negative space). The color logo sits **top-left** at master coordinates. Title is **100 px / 700** (smaller than you'd expect — that's the master's spec). No eyebrow, no subtitle, no keyline bar, no footer chrome.

The cover is intentionally minimal: **title + initiator's personal name + date, nothing else.** No English subtitle. No team / company / department label. The flower image and the title carry the entire composition. (See "Step 2 · Cover page" above for the full rationale.)

```html
<div class="slide" data-layout="cover" data-screen-label="01 Cover">
  <div class="wordmark">飞书</div>
  <div class="stage">
    <h1 class="title title-zh" data-text-id="slide-01.title">先进团队的<br>工作方式</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="author">
    <span data-text-id="slide-01.author">杰森</span><br>
    <span data-text-id="slide-01.date">2026.04.30</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

Note: cover (and `image-text`, `end`) are HERO_TITLE_LAYOUTS — `<br>` is allowed
inside their titles. The validator (R13) skips `<br>` checking on these three.

Master pixel grid (1920×1080 design canvas):
- Logo top-left: `120, 113` size `235×74` (color logo with petals + 飞书 wordmark — `lark-logo.png`)
- Title: `124, 285`, max-width `884`, font 100/700
- Author block: `124, 803`, font 30/600 — two stacked spans, name on top, date below. Do NOT use `.role` muted prefix on the cover (the date alone is enough chrome).
- Right half: reserved for the flower image — DO NOT place text there.

### 2. Agenda (`data-layout="agenda"`)

```html
<div class="slide" data-layout="agenda" data-accent="blue" data-screen-label="02 Agenda">
  <div class="wordmark">Lark</div>
  <div class="header">
    <div class="eyebrow">AGENDA · 议程</div>
    <h2 class="title-zh" style="margin-top:18px">本次汇报<br>共六个部分</h2>

  </div>
  <div class="footer"><span>Lark Suite · 2026 客户提案</span><span class="pageno">02</span></div>
</div>
```

### 3. Section (`data-layout="section"`) — matches 飞书 母版 slideLayout3 一级章节页

Chapter divider. Big numeral with a period (`02.` not `02`), section title below, optional lede + product pills. Master positioning is **160 px** for the numeral (NOT 280) — anything larger gets clipped at the line-box top by `-webkit-background-clip:text`.

```html
<div class="slide" data-layout="section" data-screen-label="03 Section">
  <div class="wordmark">飞书</div>
  <div class="chapter-num">02.</div>
  <h2 class="title title-zh">先进团队的工作方式</h2>
  <p class="lede">即时同步 · 共识对齐 · 闭环交付</p>
  <div class="pills">
    <span class="pill">飞书消息</span>
    <span class="pill">飞书文档</span>
    <span class="pill">飞书多维表格</span>
    <span class="pill">飞书知识库</span>
    <span class="pill">飞书视频会议</span>
  </div>
  <div class="footer"><span>飞书 · 2026 客户提案</span><span class="pageno">03</span></div>
</div>
```

Master pixel grid (1920×1080):
- Logo: top-right at `1677, 61` (mono-white)
- `.chapter-num`: `126, 271`, font **160/700** (master is 80 pt = 160 px on 1920 canvas)
- `.title`: `126, 447`, font **88/700**
- `.lede`: `126, 597`, font 36/500
- `.pills`: `126, bottom 96` row of ghost pills
- Background: `lark-section-bg.jpg` (cool blue glow on the right edge)

### 13. End / closing (`data-layout="end"`) — matches 飞书 母版 slideLayout8 封底带 slogan

The master closing is intentionally minimal: same flower background as the cover, the color logo top-left, and the brand slogan **"先进团队 先用飞书"** as a PNG (`lark-slogan.png`). NO title, NO CTA pills, NO contact grid. The slogan IS the message.

```html
<div class="slide" data-layout="end" data-screen-label="13 End">
  <div class="wordmark">飞书</div>
  <div class="slogan" role="img" aria-label="先进团队 先用飞书"></div>
  <!-- optional small contact line — not in the master, but allowed -->
  <div class="contact">contact@feishu.cn  ·  feishu.cn</div>
</div>
```

Master pixel grid:
- Logo top-left: `120, 121` size `235×74` (color)
- Slogan PNG: `102, 348` size `561×345` (loaded from `--fs-asset-slogan`)
- Optional `.contact` line: `124, bottom 80` (off-master but allowed)

If you genuinely need a CTA on the closing (e.g. for an internal pitch where someone asked for it), break with the master and use a pill row — but flag the deviation. Default = stay with the master.

---

## Iconography

- Use **Lucide-style inline SVG**, 24 px viewBox, `stroke: currentColor`, `stroke-width: 2`,
  `stroke-linecap: round`, `stroke-linejoin: round`, `fill: none`. Inherit color via the
  parent (`.tile` colors children to `--fs-accent` automatically).
- For production, recommend the user swap to **ByteDance IconPark** for licensing parity.
- **Never** use emoji or unicode glyphs (`✓ ✗ → 🚀`) as icons. Always real SVG.

A small library of go-to icons is included in the recipes above. When the LLM needs
a new icon, it should hand-write the SVG path rather than reference a remote URL.

---

## Single-file inlined output (recommended for delivery)

For a portable artifact, the agent should produce ONE `.html` file with CSS + JS inlined:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="zh-CN">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">
  <title>...</title>
  <style>/* paste contents of assets/feishu-deck.css */</style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="deck">
    <!-- slide-frame entries -->
  </div>
  <script>/* paste contents of assets/feishu-deck.js */</script>
</body>
</html>
```

The `examples/sample-deck.html` file is built this way and is the reference output.

---

## Layout default: content sizes itself, the stage centers it

Most decks have at least one slide where the content is genuinely shorter
than the canvas (e.g. a 3-card recommendation summary, a 3-stat KPI row, a
quote). The default layout should never leave content stranded at the top
of an empty canvas; it should center vertically and let the content take
its natural height.

This applies to **every container layout** that holds a fixed number of
content blocks: `content-3up`, `content-2col`, `agenda`, `process`,
`stats`, `big-stat`, `quote`.

> Note on container naming: the spec uses `.stage` as the canonical inner
> container. This skill's CSS uses historical aliases per layout —
> `.grid` (content-3up / content-2col / stats), `.toc` (agenda),
> `.flow` (process), `.nodes` (timeline), `.stack` (quote), `.stage`
> (big-stat). The validator (`check_default_centering`) accepts ALL of
> these as valid containers when checking for default centering.

Mechanical recipe:

```css
/* WRONG — grid grows to fill canvas, cards top-stack */
.slide[data-layout="content-3up"] .stage {
  display: flex; flex-direction: column;
}
.slide[data-layout="content-3up"] .grid {
  flex: 1;          /* claims all available height; cards stretch tall */
  align-items: stretch;
}

/* RIGHT — stage centers, grid sizes to content */
.slide[data-layout="content-3up"] .stage {
  display: flex; flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;  /* center group vertically */
  gap: 28px;                 /* spacing between grid and strap/footer */
}
.slide[data-layout="content-3up"] .grid {
  /* no flex: 1 — content-sized grid */
  align-items: stretch;      /* still equalizes cards to tallest one's content */
}
```

When the content IS dense enough to fill 80%+ of the canvas (e.g. content-3up
with strap + 3 features per card), `justify-content: center` resolves to a
top-aligned visual anyway because the content nearly fills available space.
So this default is **safe both for sparse and dense slides**.

### Counter-rule: when grid SHOULD grow

`pipeline` (Pattern I) explicitly wants the 6-step row to fill vertically so
the rail/dots/cards span the canvas — that layout uses `flex: 1` on `.steps`
deliberately. Don't strip that. The rule is: **only layouts with a fixed
content shape (3-up, 2-col, etc.) center; layouts with a stretched flow
(pipeline, timeline, process) fill.**

### Mechanical audit (extends Rule L2)

```python
def check_default_centering(css):
    """Container-layouts that aren't pipeline/timeline/process should center
    vertically by default."""
    centerable = ('content-3up', 'content-2col', 'agenda', 'stats', 'big-stat', 'quote')
    for layout in centerable:
        m = re.search(rf'\.slide\[data-layout="{layout}"\] \.stage\s*\{{([^}}]*)\}}', css, re.DOTALL)
        if not m: continue
        stage = m.group(1)
        if 'justify-content' not in stage and 'align-content' not in stage:
            yield layout  # missing default centering
```

Block delivery if any layout in `centerable` lacks centering.

The shipped `assets/validate.py` implements this as `audit_default_centering`
(rule **R48**), with the practical extension that it accepts any of
`.stage / .grid / .toc / .flow / .nodes / .stack` as a valid container for
the layout (the spec-canonical name is `.stage`; the historical names are
the per-layout aliases this skill already uses). It also accepts
`align-items: center` and `place-content: center` as equivalent centering
declarations. Functionally identical to the spec, just looser about which
selector name carries the rule.

### Failure mode this catches

User adds a recommendations slide with 3 short cards. Cards stretch to
fill canvas, content stuck at top of each card, big empty bottom across
the slide. User asks "why is there so much empty space?" — agent has to
add centering after the fact. **The default layout should already center.**

---

## Variant override discipline

When a `data-variant` re-skins an existing `data-layout`, the variant CSS does
NOT automatically reset properties from the base layout. CSS cascade only
overrides properties that the variant *explicitly declares*. So if the base
sets `flex-direction: column` and your variant only sets `display: flex`, the
column direction sticks.

**Rule:** when a variant changes the visual structure (row ↔ column,
grid ↔ flex, horizontal ↔ vertical), it MUST explicitly redeclare every
directional / structural property of the layout container — NOT rely on
shorthand or default behavior.

### Concrete recipe — variant flips a column container to row

```css
/* ---- Base layout: vertical stack ---- */
.slide[data-layout="content-2col"] .grid {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;     /* base: vertical */
  align-items: stretch;
  justify-content: flex-start;
  flex-wrap: nowrap;
  gap: 24px;
}

/* ---- Variant: flip to horizontal row — WRONG ---- */
.slide[data-layout="content-2col"][data-variant="horizontal"] .grid {
  display: flex;              /* technically already flex; doesn't help */
  /* flex-direction missing → STILL column from base — bug */
  gap: 36px;
}

/* ---- Variant: flip to horizontal row — CORRECT ---- */
.slide[data-layout="content-2col"][data-variant="horizontal"] .grid {
  display: flex;              /* explicit, even if identical */
  flex-direction: row;        /* MUST redeclare — does not auto-reset */
  align-items: stretch;       /* MUST redeclare — even if value is identical */
  justify-content: flex-start;/* MUST redeclare */
  flex-wrap: nowrap;          /* MUST redeclare */
  gap: 36px;
}
```

### Concrete recipe — variant flips a grid to flex (or vice versa)

When changing layout *engine* (grid → flex, flex → grid), every property
specific to the OLD engine becomes a no-op but doesn't disappear. You must
explicitly null them with `unset` or replace them with the new engine's
equivalents.

```css
/* Base: 3-column grid */
.slide[data-layout="content-3up"] .grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: auto;
  align-items: stretch;
  align-content: center;
  gap: 36px;
}

/* Variant: become a horizontal flex row instead — CORRECT */
.slide[data-layout="content-3up"][data-variant="flex-row"] .grid {
  display: flex;                                     /* swap engine */
  grid-template-columns: unset;                      /* null grid-only props */
  grid-template-rows: unset;
  flex-direction: row;                               /* declare flex equivalents */
  align-items: stretch;
  justify-content: center;
  flex-wrap: nowrap;
  gap: 36px;
}
```

### Why "redeclare even if identical"

The cascade is property-level, not declaration-level. If the base has
`align-items: stretch` and the variant doesn't mention `align-items` at all,
the base value sticks — which is usually what you want. But the moment you
later refactor the BASE to `align-items: center`, every variant inherits
that change silently. The bug shows up months later when "just a small base
tweak" cascades into 12 broken variants. Redeclaring all structural props
in the variant makes each variant self-contained and audit-friendly.

### Properties considered "structural / directional"

Any of these properties on a layout container constitutes structure. If
the variant changes ANY of them, it must explicitly redeclare ALL of them:

- `display`
- `flex-direction`, `flex-wrap`, `flex-flow`
- `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`, `grid-template-areas`,
  `grid-auto-flow`, `grid-auto-columns`, `grid-auto-rows`
- `align-items`, `align-content`, `align-self`, `place-items`, `place-content`
- `justify-items`, `justify-content`, `justify-self`
- `gap`, `row-gap`, `column-gap`

Properties like `padding`, `background`, `color`, `border-radius` are
*cosmetic* — a variant changing only those doesn't need to redeclare
structural props.

### Validator behavior

`assets/validate.py` includes `audit_variant_discipline` (rule **R47**).
For every CSS rule whose selector contains `[data-variant=...]`, the
validator checks: if the block declares `display:` or `flex-direction:`
or any `grid-template-*`, it must ALSO declare `align-items` and
`justify-content` (or their `place-*` shorthands). Otherwise it warns
that this variant is touching structure without redeclaring all
directional props — exactly the scenario that produces "I flipped
direction but it didn't change" bugs.

Cosmetic-only variants (e.g. `data-variant="dense"` that only changes
`gap` and `padding`) pass the audit untouched — the rule only triggers
when structural change is detected.

### Going-forward expectation

When writing or editing a `data-variant` rule:

1. Decide: is this variant **cosmetic** (color, spacing, font) or
   **structural** (layout direction, engine, alignment)?
2. If structural → redeclare every directional property listed above.
3. Run `python3 assets/validate.py deck.html` — R47 will catch any
   structural variant that forgot to redeclare alignment.
4. If a variant is intentionally only changing one structural prop and
   keeping the others, redeclare them ANYWAY with the inherited value.
   Self-contained variants are easier to refactor later.

## Re-render UI mocks as HTML, not screenshots

When adapting source content into HTML — especially when "translating" or
"re-rendering" an existing deck, slide, or marketing screenshot — **system
UI, app screens, chat threads, dashboards, spreadsheets, browser windows,
and modal dialogs MUST be recreated in HTML/CSS, not embedded as raster
images.**

### Why

| Aspect | Raster screenshot | HTML mock |
|---|---|---|
| Fullscreen scaling | Pixelates above 1× | Crisp at any res |
| Typography | Whatever the screenshot has | Brand font (`var(--fs-font-cjk)`) |
| Color harmony | Off-brand by definition | Uses `--fs-blue` etc. |
| File size | 200–800 KB JPG/PNG | 1–4 KB inline HTML |
| Inspectable | Black box | DOM, accessible |
| Licensing | Real product UI = NDA risk | Stylized recreation, safe |
| "Looks more real" | Looks pasted-in | Looks native to the deck |

### What still belongs as a raster image

- Real photographs (customer scenes, hardware shots, factory floors) →
  use `data-decor="photo-bg"` with `style="--photo: url(...)"`.
- Brand assets (the 飞书 tri-petal logo, the slogan PNG) — already inlined.
- Illustrative artwork that's genuinely artistic (the master flower image).

If it's a UI element — re-render. If it's a photograph or art — inline.

### `.data-panel` vs `.ui-window` — pick the right container

Two ways to frame structured data on a slide. They look superficially
similar, but the visual associations are very different and the rule
for picking is strict:

| Container | When to use | Visual signal |
|---|---|---|
| **`.data-panel`** (default) | You're showing structured data — status rows, KPI summaries, value-translation tables, agent step lists, "下一步" callouts. The data isn't part of any app's UI; you just need a brand-aligned framing. | Side accent bar (4 px blue / teal / violet) + clean header + gradient keyline. NO traffic lights. NO window chrome. |
| **`.ui-window` + `.ui-traffic-lights`** | You're actually mocking a macOS desktop app (real screenshot replacement). The traffic lights tell the viewer "this is a software window." | Three colored dots (red/yellow/green) + titlebar + window-style framing. |

**Default to `.data-panel`.** Reach for `.ui-window` only when the
content WOULD HAVE BEEN a screenshot of a real app — chat thread,
browser dashboard, spreadsheet panel, modal dialog. If the same
content could legitimately appear as a "report module" without app
chrome, it's a `.data-panel`.

`.data-panel` markup pattern:

```html
<div class="data-panel">                  <!-- or .data-panel.is-teal / .is-violet -->
  <h4>客户类型 · 共创进入条件</h4>
  <hr>
  <div class="row">
    <span class="lbl">先进型 · 流程已成熟</span>
    <span class="val">学过来 → 教别人</span>     <!-- default: teal -->
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <span class="lbl">中间型 · R&amp;D VP 接洽</span>
    <span class="val warn">权限不够 → 暂缓</span>  <!-- .warn = orange -->
  </div>
  <div class="ui-alert">                   <!-- .ui-alert reuses fine inside .data-panel -->
    <div class="t">下一步</div>
    <h5>古茗 / 瑞幸先进流程调研</h5>
    <p>凯轩节后跟进。</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

Tonal variants (`.is-teal` / `.is-violet`) recolor the side accent bar
and the row arrows for differentiation when multiple panels coexist on
a slide (e.g. content-2col with two side-by-side panels).

### UI primitives shipped in the CSS

The `feishu-deck.css` ships a set of `.ui-*` primitive classes that compose
into any 飞书-style app mock. All are dark-themed, brand-aware, and built
from the existing tokens. None of them require additional assets.

| Primitive             | Renders                                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **`.data-panel`**     | **Default** brand-aligned container for structured data — side accent + keyline, no window chrome. Tonal variants `.is-teal` / `.is-violet`. **Use this for non-app data;** `.ui-window` only for actual macOS app UI mocks. |
| `.ui-window`          | Generic dark app panel + 16 px radius + soft shadow — for app UI mocks |
| `.ui-titlebar`        | Top bar inside `.ui-window`                       |

### Validator behavior

`assets/validate.py` includes `audit_ui_mocks_are_html` (rule **UI1**).
It scans every slide for `<img src="…">` tags. The validator allows:
- `data:` URIs (inlined assets)
- The known brand asset filenames (`lark-logo`, `lark-slogan`,
  `lark-cover-bg`, etc.)

Anything else triggers a **warning** suggesting the `<img>` is a UI
screenshot that should be re-rendered using the `.ui-*` primitives.
In `--strict` mode this becomes an **error**. Pure photographs go through
`data-decor="photo-bg"` with `style="--photo: url(…)"`, not via raw `<img>`.

### Going-forward expectation for the agent

When asked to "translate this slide / deck / page into HTML":
1. Identify which visual elements are SYSTEM UI vs. real photographs.
2. For each UI element, pick the closest `.ui-*` primitive composition.
3. Recreate the UI in HTML/CSS using brand tokens — fonts, colors, radii.
4. Only reach for raster `<img>` when the source is a genuine photograph
   or a piece of artwork.
5. If unsure ("is this a UI screenshot or a marketing illustration?"),
   ask. The default answer is "treat it as UI and re-render".

A deck where every UI element is HTML feels native. A deck with pasted
screenshots feels like a draft.

## Layout integrity rules — execute, don't assume

These are the failure modes that hit the LKK exchange deck on first try.
Adding them as **mandatory** layout audits, not "best practice" suggestions.

### Rule L1 — Logo defaults to COLOR on every slide

`.slide .wordmark` background MUST default to `var(--fs-asset-logo)` (the
tri-petal color logo). Mono is **opt-in** via `class="is-mono"`. The mono
variant is only correct on chapter dividers / section pages where the
glow background dominates and a colored logo would clash.

```css
/* default — color */
.slide .wordmark { background: var(--fs-asset-logo) right center/contain no-repeat; }
/* opt-in mono */
.slide .wordmark.is-mono { background-image: var(--fs-asset-logo-mono); }
```

The pre-Sept-2025 spec had this backwards (mono default, color opt-in via
`is-color`). That's deprecated. **If you generate a deck where every content
slide uses the mono logo, you've broken Rule L1.**

### Rule L2 — No content stranded at the top of a slide

If a slide's content uses less than 60% of the canvas height, you MUST
either (a) center the content vertically, or (b) make it expand to fill.
**Never** leave content packed at the top with empty bottom — this is the
single most-reported visual bug from internal sales.

Mechanical fix recipe per layout type:

| Layout         | When to apply                          | CSS to add                                   |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `content-2col` | Cards shorter than canvas              | `align-content: center` on `.stage`/`.grid`  |
| `process`      | Step row natural height < canvas       | `align-content: center` on `.stage`/`.flow`  |
| `content-3up`  | Card row natural height < canvas       | `align-content: center` on `.stage`/`.grid`  |
| `pipeline`     | Steps + highlights + infra leave space | `flex: 1` on `.steps`, let it grow           |
| `timeline`     | Nodes row shorter than container       | `align-content: center` on `.nodes`          |

> The CSS in this skill uses `.grid` / `.flow` / `.nodes` as the historical
> per-layout container names. `.stage` is the canonical generic name from
> the abstract规范. Both are valid; the audit accepts any of them.

If the content is already dense enough to genuinely fill 80%+ of the canvas,
neither center-mode nor grow-mode is needed. Otherwise pick one — DO NOT
ship a top-stacked slide.

### Rule L3 — `margin-top: auto` on a stretched card creates the empty-middle bug

If a card is `display: flex; flex-direction: column` and an inner element
has `margin-top: auto` (e.g. a pills row pushed to bottom), and the parent
grid stretches the card to fill the whole stage height, the visible result
is a card with content stuck at top, pills stuck at bottom, and **a giant
empty middle**.

Fix: combine Rule L2 (center the row vertically with `align-content: center`
on the grid container) with content-sized rows (`grid-template-rows: auto`)
so cards become exactly content-tall instead of canvas-tall. Pills'
`margin-top: auto` then becomes a no-op when content already fills the card.

The shipped CSS now defaults to this safer behavior:

```css
.slide .grid > .card,
.slide .flow > .step {
  align-self: stretch;   /* equal-height within row, cosmetic */
  margin: 0;              /* override the auto-margin default — grid handles vertical placement */
}
```

### Rule L4 — Output panel attribute lists: single column when narrow

The `process` layout's output panel is ~400 px wide. If you put a 4-item
attribute list in `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr` (2×2), each cell becomes
~180 px which truncates body-floor (22 px) text like "Communication style".
Use `grid-template-columns: 1fr` (single vertical stack) when the panel
is < 480 px wide. The output panel is naturally tall — vertical stacking
fits its proportion and lets body type stay at the 22 px floor.

The shipped CSS enforces this:

```css
.slide[data-layout="process"] .output .attrs {
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;   /* never 1fr 1fr */
}
```

### Mechanical audit (extends self-check items #6, #7, #19)

The `assets/validate.py` validator now includes these checks (the function
signatures match the规范 verbatim):

```python
def check_logo_default(html):
    """Rule L1: wordmark default must reference --fs-asset-logo (color)."""
    m = re.search(r'\.slide \.wordmark \{[^}]*background:\s*([^;]+);', html, re.DOTALL)
    return m and 'asset-logo)' in m.group(1) and 'asset-logo-mono' not in m.group(1)

def check_balance(html):
    """Rule L2: every layout's stage uses center or flex-grow when content is short."""
    layouts_with_short_content = ('content-2col', 'process', 'content-3up')
    for layout in layouts_with_short_content:
        m = re.search(rf'\.slide\[data-layout="{layout}"\] \.stage \{{[^}}]*\}}', html, re.DOTALL)
        if m and not ('center' in m.group(0) or 'flex: 1' in html):
            return False, layout
    return True, None

def check_attrs_density(html):
    """Rule L4: process output attrs should be 1-col when output panel is narrow."""
    m = re.search(r'\.slide\[data-layout="process"\] \.output \.attrs \{[^}]*\}', html, re.DOTALL)
    return m and 'grid-template-columns: 1fr;' in m.group(0)
```

Block delivery if any returns False.

### Going-forward expectation for the agent

When the agent finishes writing a deck, BEFORE sending the file to the user:

1. Run the font-size audit (existing — Rule #6).
2. Run `check_logo_default` (Rule L1).
3. Run `check_balance` for every layout used (Rule L2).
4. For every `content-3up`, `content-2col`, `process` slide, eyeball whether
   `.stage` either centers or fills. If neither, fix.
5. For every `process` slide with output attrs, confirm single-column.

**The user should never have to point out a top-stacked layout, an empty
middle, or a mono logo on content slides.** If they do, it's because the
agent skipped Rules L1–L4. Re-run before you reply.

---

## Self-check must be EXECUTED, not just listed

The 39-item self-check at the bottom of this file is a hard gate, not a
checklist for your reading pleasure. Before declaring a deck "done":

1. **Run a font-size audit programmatically.** Don't trust visual feel.

   ```bash
   python3 assets/validate.py path/to/your-deck.html
   # exit 0 = pass · exit 1 = fail · exit 2 = file not found
   ```

   The shipped `assets/validate.py` script statically audits the assembled
   HTML against every check that doesn't require a real browser:

   - **Structure** (R02 / R07): every `.slide` has `data-layout`,
     `data-screen-label`, `.wordmark`, and (non-cover/end) a `.footer`.
   - **One-line titles** (R13): no `<br>` inside `.header h2` /
     `.header h2.title-zh` / `.header h2.title` on layouts other than
     `cover` / `image-text` / `end`.
   - **Brand chrome** (R07): warns when `.wordmark.is-mono` is used —
     mono-white logo must be an explicit edge case, not the default.
   - **Banned punctuation** (R05): scans rendered text for emoji, `!`/`！`,
     ellipsis `…`/`...`, `???`/`？？？`.
   - **Font-size floor** (R06): every `font-size` declaration on a selector
     that targets slide content (NOT `.deck-ui`) must be ≥ 14 px. The script
     lists each violation with the offending selector and size.
   - **No drop shadows** (R12): scans `.slide` selectors for `box-shadow`
     declarations. Recognises glow rings (`0 0 0 Npx ...`) and `inset`
     shadows as allowed; flags any real drop shadow with non-zero offset.
   - **`data-decor` token validity** (R38): every token inside a slide's
     `data-decor` must come from the ship list (`violet-glow / blue-glow /
     mix-glow / teal-glow / orange-spark / aurora / grain / topo /
     flower-bg / section-bg / photo-bg`). Misspellings produce hard fail.
   - **Hex palette** (R10): warns when slide markup contains hex values
     outside the brand palette. (SVG decoration is excluded from this scan.)
   - **Runtime chrome** (R29-R32): verifies `.deck-progress`, `.deck-controls`,
     prev/next/fs buttons, `requestFullscreen`, `fullscreenchange`, the
     keyline-gradient progress bar, and `.is-idle` auto-fade are all wired.
   - **Centering pattern** (R36): asserts present-mode uses
     `margin: -540px 0 0 -960px` (absolute centering) and NOT `display: grid`
     on `.slide-frame`.
   - **Layout integrity** (L1 / L2 / L4): logo defaults to color, every
     short-content stage has `align-content: center` (or grow), `process`
     output panel attrs are single column.
   - **Default centering** (R48): every fixed-shape layout has centering on
     its inner container.
   - **Variant discipline** (R47): variants that change structural
     properties also redeclare `align-items` + `justify-content`.
   - **UI mocks as HTML** (UI1): warns on any `<img>` in slide content that
     isn't a known brand asset or `data:` URI.
   - **Cyan as slide-accent** (R49): rejects `data-accent="cyan"` on
     `.slide` — cyan is inline-word-highlight only.

   Pass `--strict` to promote warnings (mono logos, off-palette hex) into
   errors. Default mode lets warnings pass for an in-progress deck; strict
   mode is the pre-delivery gate.

2. **Treat exit-1 as a delivery blocker.** If the script reports any error,
   fix it. Don't paper over it by editing the validator. The check is
   conservative — every flag is a real规范 violation, not noise.

3. **Run the script after EVERY rebuild.** Each time you regenerate
   `examples/sample-deck.html` (or any deck), pipe through the validator
   in the same shell command:

   ```bash
   bash build.sh && python3 assets/validate.py examples/sample-deck.html || exit 1
   ```

   This makes regression detection automatic — a CSS edit that introduces
   a 12 px font in a `.slide *` selector will be caught immediately, not
   when a customer flags it on a printed handout.

4. **Items 14, 15, 20, 21 still require a human eye.** Visual alignment of
   the title baseline with the logo center, ZH > EN balance, atmospheric
   "feel", and density of glow vs content density — the validator can't
   judge these. Open the deck at 1920×1080, 1280×720, and 380×680 and
   look. Then ship.

The current `examples/sample-deck.html` passes `validate.py` with exit 0
in both default and `--strict` mode — that's the bar.

## Preserve atmospheric / decorative backgrounds when re-rendering

When re-rendering an existing slide into a standard layout, **never silently drop
the slide's distinctive background imagery, decorative gradients, or atmospheric
overlays**. Those visuals carry tone information that the layout structure alone
cannot express — stripping them makes the redesign feel sterile and the user
notices immediately.

### What counts as "atmospheric"
- Radial decorative glows (e.g. the violet magnolia glow lower-right on
  Digital Workforce slides)
- Full-bleed photographic backgrounds beyond the cover (e.g. customer scene
  photos on `image-text` layouts)
- Brand gradients other than the default `--fs-grad-hero`
- Aurora / particle / film-grain overlays
- Hand-drawn illustrative motifs

### How to preserve them — `data-decor` attribute

Decoration is **orthogonal to layout**. A slide can carry any combination of
layout + variant + decor. Mark the decoration with a `data-decor` attribute
on the `.slide` element:

```html
<!-- Preserve the violet magnolia glow when re-rendering Digital Workforce
     into the standard 3-up content layout — layout is unchanged, atmosphere stays -->
<div class="slide"
     data-layout="content-3up"
     data-decor="violet-glow"
     data-screen-label="07 数字员工">
  ...
</div>

<!-- Stack multiple decors with space separation: cinematic mix + grain -->
<div class="slide"
     data-layout="quote"
     data-decor="mix-glow grain"
     data-screen-label="06 Quote">
  ...
</div>

<!-- Custom photographic background for an image-text style customer page -->
<div class="slide"
     data-layout="image-text"
     data-decor="photo-bg"
     style="--photo: url('./photos/store-floor.jpg')"
     data-screen-label="09 Customer">
  ...
</div>
```

### Available decor tokens (CSS already ships these)

| Token          | Renders                                      | Use for |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|---|
| `violet-glow`  | Lower-right violet bloom (#9F6FF1 + #5C3FFB) | Digital Workforce / 数字员工 / AI signature |
| `blue-glow`    | Centered blue radial (#3C7FFF)               | Quote / hero / single-focus emphasis |
| `mix-glow`     | Purple top-right + blue bottom-left          | Closing / cinematic transitions |
| `teal-glow`    | Bottom-left teal bloom (#33D6C0)             | Data / KPI / impact pages |
| `orange-spark` | Top-right warm flare (#FE7F00)               | Alert / 例外 / risk callout |
| `aurora`       | Three-color ambient (blue + violet + teal)   | Generic ambient atmosphere |
| `grain`        | Subtle film grain (CSS noise, no asset)      | Cinematic finish — pairs with any glow |
| `topo`         | Faint topographic line motif                 | Process / engineering / pipeline pages |
| `flower-bg`    | Full-bleed master flower (`--fs-asset-cover-bg`) | Carries the cover atmosphere into a content page |
| `section-bg`   | Master section gradient (`--fs-asset-section-bg`) | Color-rich chapter pages outside `section` layout |
| `photo-bg`     | Custom URL via `style="--photo: url(...)"`   | Any photographic full-bleed beyond the master assets |

### Architecture rules
1. **Decor is a `::before` (and grain a `::after`) pseudo-element.** It sits
   under all slide content (`z-index: 0`) with `pointer-events: none`. It
   never disturbs layout or hit-testing.
2. **Decor is always opt-in.** Default slides have no `data-decor` and render
   exactly as they used to. Adding decor never changes the layout.
3. **Decor stacks via space-separated tokens.** `data-decor="violet-glow grain"`
   composes the violet bloom and the grain overlay.
4. **`flower-bg` and `photo-bg` automatically add a darkening protection
   gradient** when applied to a non-cover layout, so text remains legible
   over imagery. Cover and end layouts already carry their own contrast
   strategy and skip the auto-overlay.
5. **When re-rendering an existing deck**, audit each source slide for
   atmospheric content and translate it to the matching token. If no token
   matches the source decor exactly, use the closest one and note the
   approximation — never silently drop it.

## CSS layout pitfalls (defenses already in feishu-deck.css)

The `.slide` canvas is fixed 1080 × 1920 (or 720 × 1280 native — same ratio).
Four classic flex/grid mistakes blow that canvas out. The CSS includes defenses
for all of them, but be aware:

1. **flex-column + `flex:1` child + min-content content → overflow.** Every flex
   item must also have `min-height: 0` so it can actually shrink. The CSS
   applies this to `.stage`, `.grid`, `.flow`, `.col-text` by default.
2. **CSS Grid rows take max-content height.** Use `grid-template-rows: minmax(0, 1fr)`
   and apply `min-height: 0` to grid cells. The CSS already applies `min-width: 0;
   min-height: 0` to all direct grid children.
3. **`flex-wrap: wrap` on a `min-width: 0` parent = disaster.** Mixed-width
   children blow up scrollHeight. The CSS defaults `.pills` and `.cta-row` to
   `nowrap` with `overflow-x: hidden`. If you genuinely need wrapping pills,
   declare it explicitly.
4. **Card density: stretch vs auto-margin.** Default = `.card { margin: auto 0 }`,
   so cards take their content's natural height and center vertically in the
   grid cell. Only add `class="is-stretch"` when content density actually
   requires the card to fill — otherwise you get an ugly "card filled, content
   only at top" gap. The CSS already encodes this; trust the default.

If you write a custom layout, follow these patterns. If a slide overflows in
practice, run through this list before tweaking pixel values.

---

## Embedding prototypes (iframe rules)

Decks regularly embed live UI prototypes. There's a checklist for this — every
item below has bitten us before:

1. **Always copy the prototype HTML to the deck's outputs/ folder before
   embedding.** Never use `file:///Users/.../Downloads/...` or any user-local
   absolute path. When the deck is shared, the recipient won't have that file.
   Copy → reference with a relative path (`./prototypes/foo.html`).

2. **Strip "原型 / Demo" labels at the source, not via CSS.** `grep` and
   `replace` the `<div class="…demo-label…">…</div>` out of the prototype's
   HTML. CSS hiding leaves layout artifacts and screen-reader noise. Source
   stripping is 100× cleaner.

3. **Mobile prototype → wrap in `.phone-frame`** (CSS class shipped with the
   skill):
   ```html
   <div class="phone-frame">
     <div class="phone-screen">
       <iframe src="./prototypes/mobile.html" loading="lazy"></iframe>
     </div>
   </div>
   ```
   The notch (`::before`) and home indicator (`::after`) are decorative and
   already have `pointer-events: none` — without that the user reports "buttons
   don't respond".

4. **Desktop prototype → `.desktop-frame`** (no phone shell):
   ```html
   <div class="desktop-frame">
     <iframe src="./prototypes/desktop.html" loading="lazy"></iframe>
     <div class="iframe-hint">原型可点击 · Click anywhere</div>
   </div>
   ```
   The hint pill fades out after 7 s (already in CSS) and has `pointer-events:
   none` so it doesn't block clicks.

5. **iframe content too big? Scale it.**
   ```css
   .my-iframe { zoom: 0.88; }
   /* OR with width/height compensation */
   .my-iframe {
     transform: scale(0.88);
     width: calc(100% / 0.88); height: calc(100% / 0.88);
   }
   ```

6. **iframe tabs wrapping** is usually a font-size issue. Edit the
   prototype's source: `font-size: 11px`, `white-space: nowrap`,
   `flex-shrink: 0` on tab labels. If the prototype is bundled as base64 +
   gzip, decode → edit → re-gzip → re-encode (the `python -c` one-liner with
   `base64 + gzip + JSON` is the standard move).

7. **EVERY decorative overlay above an iframe needs `pointer-events: none`.**
   That includes hint pills, phone notches, home indicators, brand watermarks,
   timestamp chrome. Without it the prototype receives clicks but nothing
   happens — and the user thinks the prototype is broken.

## Narrative patterns (DESIGN.md §9 — A through K)

Beyond the 13 base layouts, the design system carries 11 named *narrative
patterns* for specific rhetorical moves common in 飞书 internal pitches.
The CSS ships classes for the high-frequency ones. Markup recipes:

### A. 3 + 1 hero pattern — "三类需求 → 统一过滤器"
Three parallel cards on top, one full-width "hero" card below. SVG dotted
arrows from each top-card foot converge to the hero. Use this when "decision
converges from multiple inputs" (clearer than 4-up).

### B. Verdict pill matrix — `data-verdict="go|conditional|nogo"`
For "接 / 部分接 / 不接" judgments. The card border color, top 5 px head bar,
and right-corner badge all derive from `data-verdict`:
```html
<div class="verdict-card" data-verdict="go">
  <span class="badge">GO · 接</span>
  <h3 class="ctitle">立即接入</h3>
  <p class="cbody">理由 …</p>
</div>
```
Color rules: `go=teal`, `conditional=purple`, `nogo=orange`.

### C. North-Star chip — every focus-area page must carry one
Sits directly under the page header. Dashed teal border, ★ icon prefix:
```html
<span class="north-star">北极星指标 · 关键决策时长 &lt; 60 秒</span>
```

### D. Boundary band — `不做` / `做` contrast
Two cards side-by-side. Left = orange dashed, body has line-through. Right =
teal solid, body uses `<span class="hl">关键词</span>` for accent4 emphasis:
```html
<div class="boundary-band">
  <div class="boundary-no">
    <span class="pill">不做</span>
    <p class="body">为单点客户定制非通用功能</p>
  </div>
  <div class="boundary-yes">
    <span class="pill">做</span>
    <p class="body">投入到 <span class="hl">5+ 客户共有的</span> 通用能力</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

### E. Fork visualization — 1 input → N branches
Don't use a 1/2/3 sequence diagram. Structure: input card → engine badge with
ACCENT4 pulse → Y-fork SVG → N branch cards in a row. Hand-write the SVG
for now; a helper is on the roadmap.

### F. Evolution chip — `现阶段 → 未来`
Compact two-row block, `white-space: nowrap` per row, dashed border:
```html
<div class="evolution-chip">
  <span class="stage-tag">CURRENT</span><span class="stage-body">中心化协同 + 部门工作流</span>
  <span class="stage-tag">FUTURE</span><span class="stage-body is-future">联邦化协同 + 跨域 AI 工作流</span>
</div>
```

### G. Two-track structure — one role, parallel tracks
Two stacked sub-blocks per role. Each sub-block: 3 px left color bar + short
label pill + body. Use for "PM 既负责 X 也负责 Y" duality.

### H. Iron 4-corners (铁四角) — 2×2 grid + center node
Four cards in a 2×2, an absolutely-positioned circle in the middle, four SVG
guide lines from center to each card's inner edge. Each card carries: pill +
serial numeral top-right + lead + body + key-deliverable chips + hand-off
indicator. Use for "四个不可分割的协同角色".

### H+. Two-hand architecture (心脏图) — `two-hand-arch`
Use when the value proposition is "we do exactly TWO things, on a shared
base, for a single decision-maker". 4-tier vertical structure: top
decision-maker crown → SVG curved-dashed lines (blue + teal) → two hands
(left blue tinted, right teal tinted) each with 3 numbered items → bottom
base (the underlying tech stack). Brand palette only — NEVER imitate
v2-style blue+orange split; use blue+teal which matches the feishu master.

```html
<div class="two-hand-arch">
  <div class="arch-top">
    <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><polygon points="12 2 15.09 8.26 22 9.27 17 14.14 18.18 21.02 12 17.77 5.82 21.02 7 14.14 2 9.27 8.91 8.26 12 2"/></svg>

    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="arch-base">底座 · 飞书 IM · 文档 · 多维表格 · 审批 · 知识库 — <b>天然一体</b></div>
</div>
```

### I. 6-step pipeline timeline
Top horizontal rail (gradient line + 6 dots, last dot teal). Below: 6 columns
with step number, EN, ZH, 3 bullets each. Final column gets accent4 stroke +
shadow. Use for end-to-end multi-stage flows that need labels.

### J. Three-color principle band — `principle-band`
```html
<div class="principle-band">
  <span class="principle" data-color="teal">专项优先</span>
  <span class="principle" data-color="blue">相邻扩展</span>
  <span class="principle" data-color="purple">战略例外</span>
</div>
```
Each principle prefixed by a glowing dot in its own color.

### K. 1+1 vs 1+1+N boundary tags — tenant/mode choice
Two side-by-side tags. Current mode highlighted; alternative mode rendered
with `text-decoration: line-through`. Use for "我们当前做 1+1; 不做 1+1+N".

### L. North-Star Map — `north-star-map`
N-up survey of parallel projects / initiatives in a single slide. Each card
distills one project to its essentials: **idx → 项目名 → 北极星指标 →
核心售卖 → 3 个 sub-capability tag chip**. Use this on the "deck-level
overview" slide right after the agenda / section divider — it gives the
viewer a single-frame mental model before each project gets its own deep-dive.

Markup:
```html
<div class="north-star-map" style="--cols:5">
  <div class="ns-card is-blue is-hero">     <!-- .is-hero highlights the lead card -->
    <span class="idx">01</span>
    <h4>门店管理</h4>
    <span class="star-label">北极星指标</span>
    <span class="star">门店坪效</span>
    <span class="core-label">核心售卖</span>
    <span class="core">千店千面个性化</span>
    <div class="tags">
      <span class="tag-chip">人 · 排班</span>
      <span class="tag-chip">货 · 菜单</span>
      <span class="tag-chip">场 · 陈列</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="ns-card is-violet">
    <span class="idx">02</span>
    <h4>内容营销</h4>
    <span class="star-label">北极星指标</span>
    <span class="star">广告投放 ROI</span>
    <span class="core-label">核心售卖</span>
    <span class="core">素材全生命周期</span>
    <div class="tags">
      <span class="tag-chip">内容洞察</span>
      <span class="tag-chip">内容生成</span>
      <span class="tag-chip">IP 探针</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- repeat for ns-card.is-teal / .is-purple / .is-orange -->
</div>
```

Tonal variants (`.is-blue / .is-violet / .is-teal / .is-purple / .is-orange`)
recolor the idx numeral and tag chip text. Keep them in deck order so the eye
can scan left-to-right by accent. Set `--cols` (default 5) to adjust grid
density: 4-up for shorter narrative arcs, 6-up only when content stays terse.
**Why this beats a comparison table**: a table forces the eye to read across;
the map lets each card breathe and treats every project as a peer. For "5
专项" or "4 战场" content this is the strongest single-slide overview shape.

### M. Adjacency-scenes grid — `scene-grid`
3×2 = 6 cards (or `--cols` adjusted) showing how a single principle / product
applies across **N adjacent industry domains**, with a quantified **economic
lever** per scene. Each card carries:
- a top accent bar (3 px, per-card color)
- an icon tile + scene name (one row)
- a divider
- 个性化对象 / 适用对象 label
- a one-line description of WHAT is personalized
- a `.sc-lever` callout with a **bold `<em>` for the impact number**
  (e.g. `经济杠杆 · <em>报损率 ↓1pp = 头部一年增利 1-2 亿</em>`)

Markup:
```html
<div class="scene-grid" style="--cols:3">
  <div class="scene-card is-blue">
    <div class="sc-top">
      <span class="sc-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"
        stroke-width="1.6" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round"
        stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M3 7h18l-2 12H5L3 7Z"/>
        <path d="M8 7V5a4 4 0 0 1 8 0v2"/></svg></span>
      <span class="sc-name">生鲜超市</span>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <span class="sc-label">个性化对象</span>
    <span class="sc-obj">千店千策订货 · 加工 · 临期 · 调价</span>
    <span class="sc-lever">经济杠杆 · <em>报损率 ↓1pp = 头部一年增利 1-2 亿</em></span>
  </div>
  <div class="scene-card is-violet">
    <div class="sc-top">
      <span class="sc-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"
        stroke-width="1.6" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round"
        stroke-linejoin="round"><rect x="3" y="6" width="18" height="14" rx="2"/>
        <path d="M7 6V4h10v2"/><path d="M3 11h18"/></svg></span>
      <span class="sc-name">便利店选品</span>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <span class="sc-label">个性化对象</span>
    <span class="sc-obj">千店千策的 SKU 组合</span>
    <span class="sc-lever">经济杠杆 · <em>单店日销提升 5%+</em></span>
  </div>
  <!-- 4 more scene-cards … -->
</div>
```

The lever is the rhetorical hook — without a real, quantified impact number
this layout collapses into a generic "list of use cases". If you can't fill
in a credible `<em>` value for a scene, drop it from the grid; six soft
scenes are weaker than three hard ones. Per-card tonal variants
(`.is-blue / .is-violet / .is-teal / .is-purple / .is-orange`) recolor the
accent bar, icon, and label; keep adjacent cards in different tones so the
viewer can pre-attentively count the panels.

## Copy / numbering 规范

These are content rules — they affect what to *write*, not how to render it.

1. **Source footer on every content page.** Use `class="source-footer"` near
   the bottom-left: `数据来源：xxx · 内部口径`. Without this, the deck reads
   like marketing copy; with it, it reads like a board memo.
2. **Eyebrow numbering uses `01 / 02 / 03 / 04-A / 04-B / 04-C / …`** to
   express chapter+sub-page hierarchy. When a focus area expands across
   multiple pages, sub-letters are mandatory.
3. **CN ↔ EN separator:** ZH text + space + `·` + space + EN text.
   No em-dashes, no slashes, no parens.
4. **Single ACCENT4 (teal) emphasis per page.** The keyword-jump rule applies
   to *every* page, not just quote/金句. If two phrases compete for emphasis,
   pick one or step back to a neutral color.
5. **Match deck length to actual narrative arc.** A short pitch can stop on
   the last content slide — don't force a quote slide and a closing slogan if
   the story doesn't earn them. Use `end` only when there's a real "end".

## Helper-snippet recipes

Where the design system has a reusable HTML+CSS combo, treat it as a "helper".
The CSS already ships the styles; the markup is what you copy. These are the
named helpers; expand each to the recipe block above when generating a deck:

| Helper                           | Use for                              | CSS class              |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `north_star_chip(metric)`        | Pin every focus area to its KPI      | `.north-star`          |
| `verdict_card(go/cond/nogo, …)`  | Decision-judgment cards              | `.verdict-card[data-verdict=…]` |
| `boundary_band(no_text, yes_text)`| 不做 / 做 contrast                   | `.boundary-band`       |
| `evolution_chip(now, future)`    | 现阶段 → 未来                        | `.evolution-chip`      |
| `principle_band(items)`          | Three-color strategy principles      | `.principle-band`      |
| `phone_frame_iframe(src)`        | Mobile prototype embed               | `.phone-frame`         |
| `desktop_iframe(src)`            | Desktop prototype embed + hint       | `.desktop-frame`       |
| `source_footer(text)`            | Every content page footer line       | `.source-footer`       |
| `aurora_background()`            | Add `data-decor="aurora"` on `.slide`| `[data-decor~="aurora"]` |
| `fullscreen_button()`            | Already shipped in `.deck-ui`        | `.deck-controls .ctl.fs` (auto) |
| `north_star_map(N, cards)`       | Pattern L · N-up project survey, idx + title + 北极星 + 核心售卖 + 3 chips | `.north-star-map / .ns-card` |
| `scene_grid(cards)`              | Pattern M · 3×2 industry-adjacency grid with quantified economic lever per scene | `.scene-grid / .scene-card` |

Roadmap helpers (no CSS yet — write the markup by hand and follow the spec):
fork visualization, iron-4-corners, 6-step pipeline timeline, two-track
structure, 1+1 vs 1+1+N boundary tags.

## Richness primitives (v1.3) — promoted from the deck_v3 reference

The skill ships a second tier of helpers that exist specifically to STOP the
agent from delivering an austere "skeleton" deck. They were promoted from the
hand-built `deck_v3_feishu` reference build — the highest-fidelity feishu
deck the team had shipped at the time. **Use them by default**, not "if you
have time". A slide that cites a number without `.kpi-strip`, a closing without
`.cta-box`, or a transform without `.ui-wave + .report-item` is a slide that
under-delivers on what the skill is capable of.

### MANDATORY: wrap body + helpers in `<div class="stage">`

`.grid` / `.flow` / `.nodes` / `.toc` / `.table-wrap` are **absolutely
positioned** by their layout rules. So if you place a `.pullquote` /
`.cta-box` / `.kpi-strip` / `.lede` as a *direct sibling* of the body
container under `.slide`, the helper falls into normal flow at the TOP
of the slide canvas — overlapping the header. Visually broken.

The fix is to wrap the body container AND its helpers in `<div class="stage">`:

```html
<div class="slide" data-layout="content-2col" data-decor="blue-glow">
  <div class="wordmark">飞书</div>
  <div class="header"><h2 class="title-zh">…</h2></div>
  <div class="stage">                       <!-- ← MANDATORY when using helpers -->
    <p class="lede">…</p>                   <!-- optional intro -->
    <div class="grid">…body cards…</div>    <!-- body, now flows naturally -->
    <p class="pullquote">…</p>              <!-- helper, flows below body -->
    <div class="cta-box">…</div>            <!-- helper, flows below pullquote -->
  </div>
  <p class="source-footer">…</p>            <!-- stays OUTSIDE .stage -->
  <div class="footer">…</div>
</div>
```

`.stage` becomes the absolutely-positioned body zone (top:220, bottom:110,
left/right:96), and inner `.grid` / `.flow` / `.nodes` / `.toc` /
`.table-wrap` override their default absolute positioning to flow inside
the stage's flex column. Helpers stack naturally below the body.

Layouts that support `.stage` wrapper: `content-2col`, `content-3up`,
`process`, `timeline`, `table`, `agenda`, `stats`. (Cover / end / image-text /
big-stat have their own `.stage` semantics — see their layout recipes.)

For `timeline`: when wrapped in `.stage`, the `.axis` line stays as a direct
child of `.slide` (outside `.stage`) and auto-aligns to slide center.

If a slide has NO helpers (just body + footer), you can omit `.stage`
without harm. Pre-1.3.2 decks (no `.stage` wrapper anywhere) still render
correctly via the legacy absolute positioning.

### When converting an external HTML deck (the failure mode this prevents)

Every primitive below maps to a v3-pattern the agent CAN'T just drop. If the
source deck has:

| Source has | You MUST use |
|---|---|
| Italic blockquote sealing the argument | `.pullquote` (default teal · `.is-orange / .is-blue / .is-violet`) |
| Customer testimonial cards with quotation glyphs | `.voice-card` (with `::before "「"`) |
| "Next step" CTA strip with a button | `.cta-box` + `.cta-btn` (`.is-teal` for promise framing) |
| Row of small KPI/metric mini-cards | `.kpi-strip` (set `--strip-cols`; tone via `.is-teal/.is-blue/.is-orange`) |
| ROI calculator / interactive sliders | `.calc` + `.calc-row` + `.calc-result` |
| Dashboard ROI rows / system list | `.ui-row` (`.val.up/.dn` for trend tone) |
| Alert banner with title + body | `.ui-alert` (orange-tone, fixed) |
| KPI tile with label + big number + delta | `.ui-kpi` (`.is-teal` for highlight variant) |
| Audio waveform (recording / call) | `.ui-wave` with 10 `<i>` bars (animated) |
| Tagged finding/insight rows (做得好 / 漏关键 / 建议) | `.report-item` (`.is-warn` orange · `.is-info` blue) |

> **Do NOT add `<div class="grid-bg"></div>` by default.** The class still
> ships for legacy decks, but the 飞书 master content layouts already use
> `lark-content-bg.jpg` (a subtle dark ambient gradient) as their background
> via `--fs-asset-content-bg`. Adding a dot-grid on top creates double-noise
> texture that makes the page feel busy and OFF-master. Only opt in to
> `.grid-bg` if a slide explicitly needs an additional engineered/technical
> backdrop (rare; e.g. a custom whitepaper layout). Default = clean.

**Drop a primitive → you've stripped meaning the source author put there.**
This is the lesson from v1 of the v3 conversion: validator-passing ≠ visually
faithful. Compliance and richness are both required.

### Card hover & tile gradient — already on by default

Every `.card` now:
- On hover: brighter background + 1 px blue glow ring (via `box-shadow:
  0 0 0 1px`) + accent border. **No `transform: translateY(...)`** — the
  transformed hit-area moves away from the cursor and creates a hover-flicker
  loop. Color + ring affords interactivity without moving the box.
- Has a **gradient blue→violet** `.tile` instead of a flat tinted square.
- Shows `.num` at 36 px / 700 (was inheriting smaller defaults).
- Shows `.cfoot` with dashed top border + accent arrow on the right.

If you write `<div class="card"><div class="head"><div class="tile">…</div>
<div class="num">01</div></div>…</div>`, you GET the v3 visual treatment for
free. There is no `.is-rich` modifier — richness is the default.

### Process step chevron — already on by default

Every `.step` inside a `[data-layout="process"] .flow` auto-renders a blue
chevron between cards. Last step and `data-variant="vertical"` auto-hide
the chevron. No markup change.

## Performance budget (hard rules — enforced by `audit_perf`)

A 13-slide deck should be lean. The skill ships with a perf budget enforced
by `validate.py audit_perf`. Each rule has a CSS or JS fix; none of them
require an external dependency.

| ID  | Budget | Hard cap | Fix |
|-----|--------|----------|-----|
| P50 | base64 in `<style>` ≤ 100 KB (default delivery) | 250 KB error | Use `bash build.sh` (linked); single-file mode requires `<meta name="fs-deck-mode" content="inline">` |
| P51 | `backdrop-filter: blur(N)` ≤ 10 px | warn always | Drop blur radius or replace with opaque rgba |
| P52 | `new ResizeObserver()` count ≤ 1 | warn at 2+ | One document-level RO with rAF batching, iterate frames in callback |
| P53 | `addEventListener` count ≥ 8 must use `AbortController` | warn always | Wrap init in `new AbortController()` + pass `{ signal }` to every listener; expose `destroy()` |
| P54 | `.slide-frame` declares `contain: ...` | warn if missing | `.slide-frame { contain: layout paint size }` — local repaints |
| P55 | `.slide-frame .slide` declares `will-change: transform` | warn if missing | `.slide-frame .slide { will-change: transform }` + `transform: ... translateZ(0)` |

### Two delivery modes

| Mode | When | Output | base64 | Validator |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Linked (default)** | Internal use, hosted, repo deck | `examples/sample-deck.html` ≈ 24 KB + external `assets/*` | 0 KB | passes P50 |
| **Inlined (opt-in)**  | Email attachment, IM, "send-me-the-html" | `examples/sample-deck-inline.html` ≈ 360 KB | 250 KB | skips P50 (signaled by `<meta name="fs-deck-mode" content="inline">`) |

`bash build.sh` produces the linked version; `bash build.sh --inline` produces both.
The inlined HTML must include the `fs-deck-mode=inline` meta tag — `build.sh` adds it
automatically. Hand-built single-file decks must add it manually or get flagged P50.

## Content-page header — title only, no eyebrow, no sub-line

Per the 2026-04 reference deck (see attached screenshot in commit history),
the content-page header is intentionally minimal:

```html
<div class="header">
  <h2 class="title-zh">懂我的AI,可以代我做方案评审</h2>
</div>
```

That's it. **No eyebrow above. No subtitle below. No inner wrapper div.
No inline page number** (the page number lives in the footer).

The reasoning: a content slide already carries a card grid / table /
process flow / etc. as its main body. Stacking an eyebrow + title +
sub-line at the top creates visual hierarchy noise that competes with
the actual content for attention. The screenshot demonstrates exactly
this: a single white sans-serif title at top-left, the colored 飞书
logo at top-right on the same baseline, and the content below.

The CSS enforces this defensively:

```css
.slide .header .eyebrow { display: none; }
```

Even if someone copies the old eyebrow-included markup, the eyebrow
won't render. The `.eyebrow` class is still usable elsewhere (inside
cards, section dividers, stats columns, etc.) — it's only suppressed
when it sits inside a content-page `.header`.

The Hero layouts (`cover` / `image-text` / `end`) use their own `.stage`
container, not `.header`, so they're unaffected and keep their existing
title patterns.

## Self-check (run all 59 items before delivering)

Before saving the deck, walk this list. **Failing any item is a hard reject.**

```
Brand & content
[ ]  1. Each slide is wrapped in <div class="slide-frame"><div class="slide" ...>.
[ ]  2. Every .slide has data-layout AND data-screen-label set.
[ ]  3. Every .slide has exactly ONE accent (cyan = inline highlight only).
[ ]  4. ZH copy is bigger than EN copy and sits ABOVE it.
[ ]  5. No emoji. No '!', '…', '???'.
[ ]  6. Body text ≥ 22 px on canvas; chrome ≥ 14 px.
[ ]  7. Wordmark present on EVERY slide (cover/end top-left, others top-right) —
        always the COLORED logo unless class="is-mono" is explicitly set.
[ ]  8. Page numbers are zero-padded ('01') in the footer of non-cover/non-end slides.
[ ]  9. All icons are inline SVG with stroke:currentColor.
[ ] 10. All hex values come from --fs-* tokens.
[ ] 11. CJK punctuation full-width, EN punctuation ASCII, never mixed.
[ ] 12. No drop shadows on slide content (only on .slide-frame in scroll mode).

Title & header alignment
[ ] 13. Page-header H2 is ONE LINE. No <br> in .header h2 / .header .title-zh.
        Shorten the title; do NOT shrink the font. Hero 2-line titles only on
        cover and image-text layouts.
[ ] 14. Page-header H2 vertically aligned with the top-right logo (top: 61).
        Eyebrow (when used) goes BELOW the title.
[ ] 15. Title-only pages (cover, agenda, big-stat) have NO eyebrow above the
        title, so the title sits exactly on the logo line.

Layout-specific sizes
[ ] 16. Agenda numbers and item titles share the SAME font size (both 44 px).
[ ] 17. Stats .trend ≥ 20 px CJK 600 (NOT 14 px Latin uppercase).
[ ] 18. Stats .label ≥ 24 px CJK.
[ ] 19. Table <th> ≥ 24 px CJK 600 white (NOT 16 px Latin uppercase).
[ ] 20. Card titles fit on ≤ 14 CJK chars at default font size (no clash with
        right-corner numerals / verdict badges).

Copy & narrative
[ ] 21. Every content page that cites a number carries a .source-footer line
        ("数据来源：xxx · 内部口径"). Without it, the deck reads as marketing.
[ ] 22. Eyebrow numbering uses 01 / 02 / 03 / 04-A / 04-B / … sub-letters when
        a focus area expands across multiple pages.
[ ] 23. CN-EN separator inside titles/eyebrows is space + · + space.
[ ] 24. At most ONE accent4 (teal) emphasis per page — even on plain content.

Layout overflow & runtime
[ ] 25. No flex item lacks min-height: 0 inside .stage / .grid / .flow.
        No grid uses 1fr without minmax(0, 1fr) on its rows.
[ ] 26. Pill/CTA rows default to nowrap. Wrapping pill rows must declare it
        explicitly (and risk vertical overflow).
[ ] 27. iframe-embedded prototypes live in outputs/ with relative paths; every
        decorative overlay above an iframe has pointer-events: none.
[ ] 28. The deck opens correctly at viewport widths 1920, 1280, and 380.
        Page indicator + mode toggle + fullscreen button visible. Keyboard
        ←→ navigates; F toggles fullscreen.

Present-mode chrome (rendered automatically by feishu-deck.js — verify it shows)
[ ] 29. Top progress bar (3 px, --fs-grad-keyline) visible across the top of
        the viewport in present mode. Width = (cur+1)/total × 100%. Animated.
[ ] 30. Bottom-center pill bar shows: [prev] [01 / 12] [next] | [fullscreen].
        Glassmorphic background. Prev/next disabled at endpoints.
[ ] 31. Clicking 演示模式 ALSO requests browser fullscreen (one gesture).
        Clicking 退出演示 exits both. Esc exits fullscreen but stays in
        present mode (deliberate).
[ ] 32. Top progress bar + bottom control pill are HIDDEN in scroll mode.
        Esc, F-key, and ←/→ keyboard navigation work whether fullscreen or not.

Fullscreen scale & chrome
[ ] 33. Entering fullscreen does NOT clip slide content. Slide letterboxes
        (preserves 16:9) on non-16:9 displays. On true 16:9 displays, slide
        fills viewport exactly with scale = 1.
[ ] 34. After fullscreen transition the scale is correct on the FIRST frame
        (no flash of wrong size). Runtime double-rAFs + 120ms timeout for
        viewport settle.
[ ] 35. Chrome (top progress bar, mode toggle, bottom controls) auto-fades
        after 2.5s of no input in present mode and restores on any input.
        Hovering chrome cancels the fade.
[ ] 36. Slide centering uses absolute + negative margin pattern, NOT grid
        place-items, so transform/overflow clipping is deterministic.

Atmospheric / decorative preservation
[ ] 37. When re-rendering an existing slide into a standard layout, the source
        slide's distinctive atmospheric content (radial glows, full-bleed
        photos, brand gradients, aurora, film grain, illustrative motifs) is
        preserved via a data-decor attribute. NEVER silently dropped.
[ ] 38. data-decor tokens come from the ship list (violet-glow / blue-glow /
        mix-glow / teal-glow / orange-spark / aurora / grain / topo /
        flower-bg / section-bg / photo-bg). Multiple tokens stack via space
        separation. If the source decor doesn't match any token exactly, use
        the closest one and note the approximation.
[ ] 39. Decor never disturbs layout or hit-testing — it's a ::before/::after
        pseudo-element at z-index: 0 with pointer-events: none. Slide
        content stays at z-index: 1.

Hard gate · run programmatically
[ ] 40. `python3 assets/validate.py path/to/your-deck.html` exits 0.
        This script EXECUTES checks 02 / 05 / 06 / 07 / 10 / 12 / 13 /
        29-32 / 36 / 38 statically. Don't ship a deck where the validator
        is red — fix the underlying issue.
[ ] 41. `python3 assets/validate.py path/to/your-deck.html --strict`
        also exits 0 before final delivery (warnings → errors).

Layout integrity (L1-L4 — LKK exchange deck failure modes)
[ ] 42. L1 — .slide .wordmark default references var(--fs-asset-logo) (color).
        Mono opt-in via class="is-mono" only on chapter dividers / over-imagery
        edge cases. Validator: check_logo_default().
[ ] 43. L2 — every body-content stage on content-2col / content-3up / process /
        timeline / pipeline either has align-content: center OR flex: 1 declared.
        Never ship a top-stacked slide. Validator: check_balance().
[ ] 44. L3 — cards inside grids are content-tall, not stretched to canvas.
        margin-top: auto on inner pills must NOT create an empty middle.
        Validator: indirectly via L2 (centering eliminates the bug).
[ ] 45. L4 — .slide[data-layout="process"] .output .attrs is grid-template-columns:
        1fr (single column). Validator: check_attrs_density().

UI mocks
[ ] 46. UI1 — every system UI element (app windows, sidebars, chat threads,
        spreadsheets, dashboards, modal dialogs) is recreated in HTML using
        the .ui-* primitives, NOT embedded as a raster screenshot.
        Validator: audit_ui_mocks_are_html — warns on any <img> in slide
        content that isn't a known brand asset or data: URI. Real photographs
        go through data-decor="photo-bg" with style="--photo: url(...)".

Variant discipline
[ ] 47. R47 — every CSS rule whose selector contains [data-variant=...] AND
        declares any structural property (display, flex-direction, flex-wrap,
        grid-template-*) MUST also redeclare both align-items (or place-items)
        AND justify-content (or place-content). Cosmetic-only variants
        (color/padding/font/gap) are exempt. Validator: audit_variant_discipline.

Default centering for fixed-shape layouts
[ ] 48. R48 — every container layout that holds a fixed number of content
        blocks (content-3up, content-2col, agenda, stats, big-stat, quote)
        default-centers vertically via justify-content / align-content /
        align-items / place-content : center on its inner container
        (.stage / .grid / .toc / .flow / .nodes / .stack). pipeline /
        timeline / process are documented exceptions that fill instead.
        Validator: audit_default_centering / check_default_centering.

Cyan-as-slide-accent forbidden
[ ] 49. R49 — cyan (#24C3FF) is INLINE-WORD-HIGHLIGHT only via .accent-text
        / .hl. Slides with data-accent="cyan" are rejected. The CSS no
        longer ships a `[data-accent="cyan"]` rule; if a slide tries to
        opt in, the variable doesn't resolve. Validator:
        audit_no_cyan_accent.

Performance budget
[ ] 50. P50 — base64 in <style> ≤ 100 KB on the default linked deck
        (≤ 250 KB hard cap). Inlined-mode decks must declare
        `<meta name="fs-deck-mode" content="inline">` to skip this check.
        Validator: audit_perf.
[ ] 51. P51 — backdrop-filter blur radius ≤ 10 px (GPU cost scales with
        radius; opaque rgba is preferable in most cases).
[ ] 52. P52 — at most ONE `new ResizeObserver(...)` instance in the runtime.
        One document-level RO with rAF batching is the规范.
[ ] 53. P53 — runtime uses `AbortController` (or `removeEventListener`) for
        every `addEventListener` so SPA hosts can `destroy()` cleanly.
[ ] 54. P54 — `.slide-frame { contain: layout paint size }` is set so slide
        changes are local repaints, not full-document.
[ ] 55. P55 — `.slide-frame .slide { will-change: transform }` (with a
        `translateZ(0)` in the transform value) gives the slide a GPU
        layer, avoiding CPU rasterization on every transition.

Content-page header minimalism
[ ] 56. R56 — content-page `.header` contains ONLY a single `<h2>` title.
        No `.eyebrow`, no inline page-no, no inner wrapper div. The
        page number lives in the footer. CSS defends this with
        `.slide .header .eyebrow { display: none }` — but the markup
        should be clean too. Validator: audit_header_minimal.

Conversion compliance (when re-rendering external material)
[ ] 57. C1 — when converting external material (PDF / HTML / PPT export),
        every source page is mapped to ONE of the 13 layouts using the
        identification table in the "Converting existing material" section.
        Cover pages use `data-layout="cover"` (NOT a content layout).
        End pages use `data-layout="end"` (NOT a content layout with a
        manually-built thank-you grid). No 14th invented layout.
[ ] 58. C2 — during conversion, source-only artifacts are STRIPPED before
        rendering: source page numbers (use the footer pageno only),
        watermarks, decorative breadcrumbs, kicker text above titles,
        emoji / `!` / `…` / `???`, and `<br>` inside content-page titles.
        Atmospheric content (radial glows, photographic backgrounds, brand
        gradients) is PRESERVED via `data-decor` (see "Preserve
        atmospheric / decorative backgrounds"). System UI screenshots
        are RECREATED in HTML via `.ui-*` primitives, not embedded as
        raster (UI1).

Local-mount preflight
[ ] 59. PREFLIGHT — `bash assets/preflight.sh` exits 0. The skill is NOT
        running from `/sessions/*/mnt/outputs/` (ephemeral). The skill
        root is writable. All required asset files are present. If
        any of these fails, refuse to generate any HTML and tell the
        user to mount a local folder.
```

If any item fails, fix the slide. Don't ship a deck that fails item 5 — emoji on a
飞书 sales slide is the single fastest way to break trust with the audience.
